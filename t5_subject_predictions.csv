"generate subject: has ferc gone far enough in california
the federal energy  regulatory commission isnt going far enough in its 
attempt to reform the  california wholesale electric market according to a 
paper by three prominent  economists done for san diego gas and electric the 
paper by john d chandley  scott m harvey and william w hogan argues that 
ferc should first end the  artificial separation that divides the california 
power exchange and the  california independent system operator rather than 
worrying about the  governance of the two institutions
the change in governance may help says  the paper  electricity market 
reform in california  but it is not likely to  be decisive in the near 
term explicit guidance from the commission regarding  the nature and 
trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be  
accomplished within an acceptable time frame hogan of the kennedy school 
of  government has been writing since 1995 in opposition to californias 
market  separation
also argues the paper freeing the california utilities to  engage in 
forward contracting is no panacea the expectation that merely  allowing 
utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be  the 
solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions  
staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to  
sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse if the  
underlying problem in california is high cost and low capacity requiring  
forward contracting could harm not only california but also the entire 
western  us electric system
fercs 150 socalled soft cap is a wild card that  has the three 
economists scratching their heads it does not appear in the  staff report 
and there is little critical analysis of their implications other  than the 
discussion of commissioner curt hebert if the intent of the soft  cap is 
to move toward cost justification for bids above 150mwh then ferc is  
headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead  
price controls in the natural gas industry
if on the other hand the soft  cap is truly soft and would only require 
some paper work at ferc and the  possibility of a refund if the price is 
eventually deemed not just and  reasonable there might be little impact on 
consumer prices particularly if  the principal sources of those high prices 
are high costs and regional capacity  shortages rather than the exercise of 
market power even so the proposal might  serve to deter entry and new 
investments thus combining the worst of both  worlds high consumer prices 
and little or no new investment
fercs  proposed order in california also demonstrates confusion about just 
what  constitutes market power the paper cites the proposed orders 
lawyerly  obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support 
findings of  specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to 
reach definite  conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is 
clear evidence  that in california market structure and rules provide the 
opportunity for  sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and 
can result in unjust  and unreasonable rates under the federal power act 
the economists note in  this regard the debate is confused because we are 
dancing around the words  where the truth may be hard to face
in the case of california say the  economists there is no evidence of 
market power even the practice of  generators avoiding the dayahead market 
in favor of the realtime market is a  response to bad market design and 
pricing incentives including price caps but  does not demonstrate the 
exercise of market power nor is bidding above  marginal cost necessarily an 
exercise of market power they add the  distinction between direct marginal 
cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost  in the discussion hence a 
competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation  is 40 but who could sell 
the same energy outside california for 100 should bid  no less than 100 
this would not be an exercise of market power",from todays electricity daily,has ferc gone far enough in california

rules will be similar to the weekly pool but the whole playoff series will
be treated as one week  you will decide how many points to give each
potential game winner and since there are eleven games you have from 111
points available for the entire playoffs  but you cannot use the same
number more than once  each week you turn in your picks for the teams
playing that particular week  that means you have only one number left for
the super bowl  please note in the schedule of payouts below that there is
a payout of 5000 for last place  this could make it interesting for
someone who hasnt done too well and helps to keep them in the pool
however if you do not turn in picks for a week you will be disqualified

the dolphins h eld alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries considering the strength of the miami defense alexanders final numbers looked respectable but he also fumbled twice the seattle rb will continue to post good yardage numbers but the leagues better defenses might limit his overall output

oronde gadsden  wr mia  free agent updated 102801
gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at seattle miamis no 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a fantasy backup

james mcknight  wr mia  free agent updated 102801
mcknight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a td at seattle but also lost a fumble the miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive

ron dayne  rb nyg  free agent updated 102801
dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by washington he is not putting up consistently good numbers and should not start for most fantasy teams right now

amani toomer  wr nyg  hardtail amigos updated 102801
toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a td against washington he remains a muststart fantasy player no matte r  what the opposition is

stephen davis  rb was  texok updated 102801
davis rushed for 107 yards against the giants but was held out of the end zone again he is still running for good yardage but the redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball

tony banks  qb was  free agent updated 102801
banks threw for 190 yards two tds and was not intercepted by the giants right now the erratic qb is playing well enough to be used as a fantasy reserve

duce staley  rb phi  taydang updated 102801
staley played sunday against oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries with two catches for 35 yards he was going up against a tough raiders rush defense and should post better stats in future weeks however it bears noting that correll buckhalter led the eagles with seven carries which suggests that neither back is the clear goto guy right now that makes both risky starts

charlie garner  rb oak  grigsby updated 102801
garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown sunday at ph il adelphia this outing could put him firmly in place as the raiders featured back while tyrone wheatley remains sidelined

rich gannon  qb oak  pink panthers updated 102801
gannon passed for just 158 yards no touchdowns and no interceptions in sundays game at philadelphia he was facing a tall challenge in the eagles secondary and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks

donovan mcnabb  qb phi  free agent updated 102801
mcnabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns sunday against oakland but he didnt get intercepted either it was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the raiders defense but this was still a disappointment mcnabb is in a bit of a slump right now but he should break out of it and be a useful fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season

michael pittman  rb ari  top dogs updated 102801
pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards sunday at dallas he hasnt been much better than thomas jones this season and we dont think either player will be a reliable fantasy option for the remainder of the year

david boston  wr ari  tomaski updated 102801
boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in sundays game at dallas while jake plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a fantasy perspective boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the arizona passing game hes easily a solid no 2 receiver on any team

jake plummer  qb ari  tomaski updated 102801
plummer passed for 233 yards no touchdowns and two interceptions in sundays game at dallas further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be unless the matchup dictates otherwise you shouldnt rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis

cowboys  dt dal  hardtail amigos updated 102801
the cowboys held the cardinals to three points sunday and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game dallas defense has been somewhat decent from a fantasy perspective based on the matchup but dont let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out

clint stoerner  qb dal  free agent updated 102801
stoerner completed 9of18 passes for 93 yards no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in  su ndays game against arizona these numbers arent great for the fantasy owner and they came against a weak cardinals secondary we dont recommend stoerner for your team based on this outing

emmitt smith  rb dal  pink panthers updated 102801
smith left sundays game against arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries he will be evaluated shortly

rob johnson  qb buf  metz updated 102801
johnson left sundays game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury he was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by alex van pelt before he returned

"generate subject: fyi  fairly accurate account of the activities in california   assembly 
released new version of hertzbergs bill late last night  another update to 
follow shortly 

best
jeff


state senate oks bailing out edison from bankruptcy 
assembly plans own version for utility 
lynda gledhill and robert salladay chronicle sacramento bureau
saturday july 21 2001 
2001 san francisco chronicle 
url  
sacramento  the state senate approved a plan yesterday to keep southern 
california edison from falling into bankruptcy but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and gov gray davis faces an 
uncertain future 
the bill by democratic sens richard polanco of los angeles and byron sher of 
palo alto would give the state a fiveyear option to buy the utilitys 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than 25 
billion of the utilitys debt edison amassed an estimated 35 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen 
the assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to californias botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers 
davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before aug 15 a date set in the original agreement between davis and 
edison 
lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town 
its a firm deadline which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess davis said of the aug 15 date 
davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days 
i have problems with both bills davis said i am heartened by the fact 
that theres a bill moving in each house 
both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process 
in the senate 22 democrats voted for the edison plan while four democrats 
and all 13 republicans voted no 
sen jackie speier dhillsborough said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form but not if any substantial changes are made 
the legislature is illequipped to try to craft a deal she said this 
particular measure  and only this one  has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers im leery of the bill going to the assembly and being 
cannibalized 
the senate bill authorizes edison to issue 25 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks the bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged edisons largest customers and would not 
cover the 1 billion edison owes outofstate generators 
edison maintains that the senate bill will not make the company creditworthy 
which would put it back in the position of buying power 
the state has been spending upward of 50 million a day on power since 
january and davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power there is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get pacific gas  electric co out of bankruptcy 
in the assembly two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill the rescue plan by assembly speaker robert hertzberg of sherman 
oaks and assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek was undergoing changes to 
garner more support 
some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal 
assemblywoman elaine alquist dsan jose one of the undecided members on the 
edison agreement said the original bill was too complex 
its a cleaner bill alquist said i think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to pge i would say 
im tentatively satisfied 
alquist and other democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the edison negotiations only a few members of the assembly  all former 
state senators now in the lower house  voted to approve the 1996 
legislation ab1890 that brought deregulation to california 
assemblyman joseph simitian dpalo alto said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
hertzbergkeeley plan in the appropriations committee in order to get the 
measure to the assembly floor and continue debate 
as weve learned from the experience of ab1890 the devil is in the details 
i have a lot of questions simitian said the difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline and then once there is a 
deadline too much gets done 
hertzberg acknowledged that some assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed but he said lawmakers are wellinformed about the energy 
crisis and its details he said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis 
a wild card in the assemblys plan was a bill by assemblyman rod wright d 
los angeles that garnered republican support the socalled straight 
bailout would give edison its 35 billion through a 2amonth fee levied 
on utility ratepayers it was stuck in the assembly appropriations committee

3 change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage

weather an early test for fee caps any severe jump in prices will likely be 
curbed experts say
by dale kasler
bee staff writer
published june 20 2001 
california electricity prices have shot back up recently potentially posing 
an early test of a new federal pricecontrol plan that takes effect today 
warm weather has sent wholesale prices doubling this week partially 
reversing a dramatic slide that had some state officials believing theyd 
tamed the wildly unpredictable california electricity market 
the rebound in prices would be expected said arthur odonnell editor of 
the california energy markets newsletter its 110 degrees in phoenix and 
its 100 degrees in sacramento and points in between 
prices this week moved back above 100 a megawatt hour about double what 
they were last week  although well below the roughly 300 suppliers were 
charging california in midmay prices showed signs of stabilizing tuesday 
analysts said 
experts said the federal energy regulatory commissions new pricemitigation 
plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes this will eliminate the 
astronomical prices said severin borenstein director of the university of 
california energy institute 
but the plan probably wont bring california a cascade of cheap power 
either 
prices likely will bump up constantly against fercs new price caps which 
will fluctuate from time to time and theyre not likely to go much below the 
caps unless theres a significant glut of energy said peter stiffler of the 
energy consulting firm economic insight inc 
traders will always trade in at the price ceiling stiffler said theyre 
going to offer power at the highest price they can 
the fluctuating ferc caps are tied to the production costs of the 
leastefficient mostexpensive generating plant operating in california when 
supplies are tight and an official power alert is declared by the states 
independent system operator which runs most of the power grid when there 
isnt a power alert prices cant exceed 85 percent of the price established 
during the most recent alert 
ferc said the system would begin today with a cap of 10849 a megawatt hour 
but would rise to 12764 if a power alert is declared 
but the cap can fluctuate significantly under the old ferc plan the price 
cap in may was set at 267 a megawatt hour the old plan was similar to the 
new system but applied only to california and only kicked in during power 
alerts 
with the caps flexible generators could have incentives to withhold power at 
some plants in order to raise the caps said stanford university economist 
frank wolak 
the ferc plan still doesnt solve the problem of withholding said wolak 
chairman of the isos market surveillance committee 
wolak also said hes afraid ferc will let power generators exaggerate their 
costs in order to bump up the caps 
the good news is they seem to be more serious wolak said of the 
oftcriticized commissioners but given how many times weve been taken in 
im wary 
in addition generators will be allowed to exceed the price caps if they can 
justify it to ferc officials borenstein said ferc in the past has allowed 
generators to justify just about every price level imaginable and hes 
suspicious that the commission will let generators do the same in order to 
evade the new price controls 
state officials while cautiously optimistic about the plan were upset that 
ferc will allow a 10 percent price premium on electricity because of the risk 
of selling to the california market 
we recognize that the risk of nonpayment in california continues to be 
greater than in other states the commission said in its written opinion 
released late tuesday 
gov gray davis spokesman steve maviglio called the premium ludicrous 
because the state department of water resources has been buying electricity 
ever since the states troubled utilities exhausted their credit in 
midjanuary 
the state is as creditworthy a buyer as you can get maviglio said 
experts said the plan also wont correct the states energy imbalance 
none of this is going to have much effect on blackouts borenstein said 
this is solving part of the problem im worried people will think 
everything has been solved 
the emphasis now has to be on getting california to conserve he added 
a spokesman for power generators gary ackerman said the price controls 
could worsen shortages this summer and will discourage generating firms from 
investing in the new power plants the west desperately needs 
builders are going to sit on the fence and think about this said ackerman 
head of the western power trading forum 
acting in the face of mounting political pressure and unrelenting criticism 
from california ferc voted monday to impose roundtheclock price controls 
throughout the 11state western region 
the ferc plan replaces a threeweekold plan that applied only to california 
and took effect only when power reserves fell to below 7 percent of demand 
and an official power alert was declared 
by extending the plan to the entire west experts said the commission 
probably put an end to the phenomenon known as megawatt laundering in 
which power was shipped out of california and then reimported imported 
power wasnt subject to the old price controls 
the new controls said consultant stiffler significantly narrow the ability 
of a trader to move power around and play the market

state to borrow up to 5 billion to buy energy 
by emily bazar
bee capitol bureau
published june 20 2001 
state treasurer phil angelides announced tuesday that he will borrow up to 5 
billion to pay for future power purchases a move he said was necessary to 
avoid a continued drain on californias budget and cuts in other state 
programs 
since midjanuary energy purchased by the state department of water 
resources on the spot market and under longterm contracts has come out of 
the states general fund the source of most state spending 
once the loan becomes final by the end of next week however energy will be 
purchased with the proceeds 
made possible by an emergency order from the governor the loan ultimately 
will be paid off by customers of the states investorowned utilities through 
their electricity rates 
in essence it stops the general fund bleeding angelides said 
the state has so far committed 82 billion from the general fund to 
electricity purchases of that amount angelides said the department of water 
resources has actually spent about 61 billion through june 12 on power 
purchases and has received about 900 million back from customers 
electricity rates 
officials expect the loan to finance power purchases through september when 
they plan to issue up to 134 billion in revenue bonds 
the bonds will reimburse the general fund and and pay off the loan 
this gives the state some more running room some more cushion in case 
anything goes awry with the bond sale to make sure  the state does not run 
out of general fund money jeopardizing education programs law enforcement 
programs childrens and health services the democratic treasurer said 
angelides said he has obtained firm commitments for 35 billion from jp 
morgan and lehman brothers at a blended interest rate of about 45 percent 
if the longterm bonds are not issued by oct 31 the interest rate would 
climb to about 7 percent 
lawmakers initially had hoped to close the shortterm loan in may and float 
the longterm bonds shortly thereafter however republicans in the state 
legislature balked at the plan forcing the delay of the bond sale until 
midaugust 
rather than wait gov gray davis invoked his emergency powers to allow for 
the loan and circumvent the delay 
assembly republicans dont mind that the governor used his emergency powers 
to expedite the loan said james fisfis a spokesman for the caucus instead 
he said theyre concerned the loan could backfire and hurt californians 
if the larger bond offering falls through the penalties and added interest 
could add up on ratepayers bills he said 
but angelides argued that the loan would benefit ratepayers on several 
fronts power generators can no longer argue the state should pay a credit 
premium on electricity he said and for the most part will not be able to 
walk away from longterm energy contracts that have provisions requiring the 
department of water resources to obtain external financing by july 1 
outside the legislature the announcement drew praise from financial analysts 
who had criticized the state for buying power with taxpayer money 
in late april for instance standard  poor cited fears over the states 
mounting power costs when it downgraded californias credit rating on state 
bonds 
but sp managing director steven zimmermann called the governors executive 
order a step in the right direction 
were very happy zimmermann said we were very anxious for the state to 
take the general fund out of the energy purchasing position its been in

dan walters once burned lawmakers are very wary of davisedison agreement


published june 20 2001 
the capitols politicians rarely attempt to resolve big complicated policy 
issues preferring to occupy their time with relatively trivial matters  
which also tend to be the priorities of wellheeled and generous interest 
groups 
and when they even acknowledge a need to address something big theyll often 
just nibble at the edges rather than confront the underlying conflicts 
squarely thats been the pattern on water transportation population growth 
and public education to name but a few of many examples 
the capitol completed just one comprehensive or seemingly comprehensive bit 
of policymaking during the last quartercentury but the issue on that 
occasion was electric utility deregulation which has exploded into an energy 
crisis of monumental proportions and that experience is having a paralyzing 
effect on the capitols denizens 
some capitol oldtimers call it 1890 disease named after the number of the 
1996 bill that created californias fatally flawed system of pricing electric 
power the legislation was written largely by lobbyists for affected interest 
groups and then presented to the full legislature for takeitorleaveit 
approval the measure was passed without a single dissenting vote even 
though only a few lawmakers even began to understand its ramifications 
it was a huge failure of the legislative process virtually a dereliction of 
duty and those who participated have been doing some fancy explaining but 
given the history both veteran legislators and those who came to the capitol 
after 1996 are very leery about putting their names on additional pieces of 
energy policy that could backfire if the realworld outcome is markedly 
different from the purported effects 
one example is the 43 billion in longterm energy supply contracts 
negotiated by gov gray davis administration to end the states dependence 
on volatile spot market prices when the longterm contracting program was 
authorized by the legislature early this year it was on the assurances of 
the administration that it could obtain large quantities of power at cheap 
prices but by the time that the contracts were made final months later the 
average price was 25 percent higher than what was stated earlier while the 
spot market had fallen dramatically now the longterm contracts that seemed 
like such a good idea in january and february could become financial 
albatrosses 
an even more telling example is the deal davis made with southern california 
edison to keep the utility from joining pacific gas and electric in 
bankruptcy the utilities accumulated at least 13 billion in debts in six 
months buying power at prices much higher than they were allowed to 
recapture from their customers consumer groups are denouncing the edison 
deal as a corporate bailout that would impose multibilliondollar burdens on 
customers while imposing virtually no financial onus on edison or its 
creditors and the deals critics are pouncing on legislators reluctance to 
do something that might haunt them later  especially in 2002 a critical 
election year 
five years ago lawmakers and the utilities foolishly foisted this 
deregulation scheme onto california consumers and now the governor and 
edison expect the ratepayers to pay billions more to save the utilities from 
their own mismanagement and bad policy decisions consumer gadfly harvey 
rosenfield said tuesday as legislative hearings opened on the edison deal 
this time the whole world is watching the legislature 
harry snyder of consumers union echoed rosenfields pledge to hold 
legislators accountable it looks a lot like 1890 snyder said its too 
big and this is the same process all over again 
the sheer complexity and potential ramifications of the deal are weighing 
heavily on lawmakers this is not a mothers day resolution senate energy 
committee chairwoman debra bowen said wryly as the hearings began davis and 
edison lobbyists are pulling out all the stops but legislators are very 
very nervous about taking another big step that could generate public 
backlash

senate democrats lay back to see if ferc action provides rate relief 



by finlay lewis
copley news service 
june 19 2001 
washington  key senate democrats called a truce tuesday in the political 
wars raging over californias energy crisis as they adopted a waitandsee 
posture over the federal energy regulatory commissions latest order 
restricting electricity prices across much of the west 
senators of both parties expressed relief over fercs action on monday but 
sen dianne feinstein dcalif said she was skeptical that the order would 
end wholesale price manipulation by power providers or result in refunds to 
overcharged ratepayers 
feinstein and sen gordon smith rore have prepared legislation seeking a 
much tighter pricing formula than the one ferc used but she asked that their 
bill be set aside temporarily in deference to the agencys action 
i think we should wait and see what happens feinstein said during a senate 
energy and natural resources committee hearing on the ferc order 
democrats on the committee pressed ferc chairman curtis l hebert and the 
four other commissioners on why they had not acted sooner to control the 
daily price turbulence in the california energy market a marketintervention 
order issued by ferc in april was designed to cope only with energysupply 
emergencies despite pleas by california gov gray davis and other california 
democrats for more drastic measures 
its time to stop blaming and start problemsolving said hebert a 
republican appointed chairman by president bush 
hebert noted that electricity prices on the volatile spot market have dropped 
considerably since the april order prices on the energy futures market have 
also tumbled as have natural gas prices  a key component in the cost of 
electricity 
on monday ferc unanimously ordered aroundtheclock restraints on wholesale 
electricity prices in california and 10 neighboring states over the next 15 
months 
as was the case with the april measure prices will be pegged to the costs of 
the least efficient power provider when reserves in california fall below 7 
percent but when reserves are more plentiful the prices will drop to 85 
percent of the level established during supply shortages 
the order also provides for a 22day period involving arbitration and review 
by an administrative law judge for resolving pricegouging allegations and 
providing refunds in cases of improper pricing 
adamantly opposing price controls earlier ferc acted after coming under 
intense pressure from lawmakers of both parties republicans said they were 
worried that their gop colleagues in california would have been blamed and 
possibly imperiled at the polls if ferc had failed to act 
bush who also took a hard line against price caps blessed fercs action 
after it was taken 
hebert criticized the bill advanced by feinstein and smith as an attempt to 
solve californias problem by bureaucratic fiat 
their measure would calculate wholesale electricity prices based on the 
reported production costs of the individual generators with an added 
allowance for a profit margin 
hebert argued that the mitigation price that ferc will establish is not a 
blunt arbitrary figure that bears no resemblance to market conditions and is 
subject to political pressures and whims 
meanwhile commissioner william massey made it clear that he harbors 
misgivings about the ferc measure although he supported it 
he said the agency should have acted earlier to avoid the subsequent 
carnage in california has failed to provide guidelines that would assure 
refunds to overcharged consumers and has acted questionably in allowing power 
providers to impose a 10percent surcharge to cover creditworthiness risks 
massey a democrat who has consistently criticized his colleagues for moving 
too slowing in the california crisis also said he wondered whether the order 
would provide an unintended incentive for generators to continue using 
inefficient units in order to assure higher profit margins for their more 
modern facilities 
sen barbara boxer dcalif said she would propose legislation later this 
week designed to assure refunds to customers who have had to pay unfair 
prices for their electricity 
if ferc wont do it  congress should boxer said 
a spokesman for sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of the committee said 
bingaman agreed with feinstein on the need for a timeout while the ferc 
order is being implemented 
gov davis will testify today 620 before the senate government affairs 
committee which is investigating fercs role in the crisis hebert and the 
other commissioners will also appear 






house panel erases bush energy cuts 



by alan fram
associated press 
june 19 2001 
washington  a house subcommittee voted tuesday to spend 12 billion more 
next year than president bush proposed for energy and water programs 
underlining lawmakers sensitivity to the wests power problems and their 
desire for homedistrict projects 
the 237 billion measure approved by voice vote by a panel of the house 
appropriations committee is normally one of the more routine of the 13 
annual spending measures congress must approve but with this years 
escalating battle between bush and democrats over energy policy the 
measures profile has been raised 
the bill would provide 187 billion for the energy department 641 million 
more than bush requested and 444 million more than this year fiscal 2002 
which the bill covers begins oct 1 
it also includes nearly 45 billion for the army corps of engineers and the 
hundreds of water projects it has under way across the country 568 million 
more than bush proposed but 73 million less than this year 
the measure was approved shortly after top members of the committee met with 
bush at the white house 
participants said bush and the lawmakers reaffirmed their goal of keeping the 
price tag of the 13 bills to 661 billion which is onethird of the overall 
federal budget that would be a 4 percent boost over 2001 which many 
democrats  and some republicans in private  say is too low 
he said there would be attempts to raise this as we go through the process 
and lets stick with him said rep sonny callahan rala chairman of the 
energy and water subcommittee 
illustrating the pressures republicans face david sirota spokesman for the 
democrats on the committee said the bill lacked the new spending needed for 
renewable energy and other programs that could help alleviate power 
shortages 
under the bill approved tuesday renewable energy programs would get 377 
million 100 million more than bush wanted and 1 million more than this 
year nuclear energy basic energy sciences biological and environmental 
research and a study of whether spent nuclear fuel should be stored at a 
nevada site would all get about what bush proposed 
the bills 703 billion for environmental cleanups is 699 million more than 
bush proposed programs aimed at containing the nuclear arsenals of former 
soviet states would get 845 million 71 million more than bushs plan 
members voted to hold the brief meeting behind closed doors after citing the 
national security sensitivity of publicly discussing some of the nuclear 
weapons programs covered by the bill 






davis regulators face off at hearing

from reuters 

washington  california governor gray davis a democrat today blamed a 
republicanled energy regulatory agency for not doing enough to help his 
energystarved state and demanded refunds of 67 billion for alleged 
pricegouging by power generators
davis whose political future has been linked to his states electricity 
woes was testifying at a senate hearing with members of the federal energy 
regulatory commission
the hearing marked the first time that davis met face to face with all 
five ferc commissioners
ferc regulates interstate electricity markets and has jurisdiction to 
order refunds by power generators found to have overcharged utilities
earlier this week the agency led by a republican majority rejected 
davis pleas for strict caps on prices that soared above 400 per megawatt 
hour last month
sen joseph lieberman the former democratic vice presidential nominee 
heads the senate governmental affairs committee that quizzed the ferc 
commissioners and davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic western 
electricity market
davis accused ferc of failing to act aggressively against alleged 
pricegouging by outofstate generators
to date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to 
californians davis said it is unconscionable for the generators to profit 
from their egregious overcharges ferc must move quickly to enforce the law 
and order the energy companies to give back the money
davis said the state is owed refunds of at least 67 billion 
californias grid operator has estimated that from may 2000 to may 2001 
power generators charged the state nearly 9 billion more than a competitive 
market would warrant he said
california the nations most populous state has been hit with a series 
of rolling blackouts the bankruptcy of its largest utility and an economic 
slowdown since the power crisis began last year
the state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate 
whether some power generators withheld supplies shut down plants or 
exploited the bidding process to drive up prices outofstate generators 
deny any illegal activity saying the high prices simply reflect supply 
shortages
today also marks the day that fercs newly expanded price mitigation 
program goes into effect in all 11 western states with a wholesale price 
limit of 1079 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula the plan had 
previously applied only to california during emergency power outages
since fercs action earlier this week senate democrats dropped a 
legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the west however 
california democrats in the house were still trying to force a full vote on a 
package of energy amendments including a price cap
the bush administration and many republicans oppose price caps 
contending they would discourage more power production
separately today the us energy department issued a study that 
supported the white houses view that strict price caps would hurt not help 
california
the study found california faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts 
this summer a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at 
150 per megawatt because some 3600 megawatts of generating capacity would 
shut down an alternative approach of setting a price cap based on production 
costs plus 25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1300 megawatts of 
capacity scheduled to be built in the state according to the study
however lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some 
kind of solution to address the shortages in california well before the 
congressional elections next year
the ferc plan expands an existing price mitigation program in 
california to 10 other western states the plan which runs through september 
2002 means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power 
cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a stage 1 
power shortage emergency in california
a stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7 
percent of demand on the western power grid
the plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into 
california as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the 
states financially weak utilities
davis was due to meet the two newest ferc commissioners patrick wood of 
texas and nora brownell of pennsylvania today both are former utilities 
regulators in states that successfully deregulated their power industry and 
nominated to the agency by president bush

news analysis
energy on agenda but issue is blame 
politics gov davis will try to sway voter anger toward the gop as he faces 
a senate panel 

by ronald brownstein times political writer 

washingtonwhen california gov gray davis testifies at a highprofile 
senate hearing today the issue formally on the table will be the expanded 
electricity price controls that federal regulators approved this week but 
the sessions political subtext will be the escalating struggle between davis 
and national republicans to determine where california voters look for 
solutionsand blamefor the states power woes
in both california and washington republican strategists believe davis 
is trying to manufacture a succession of conflicts with the white house that 
will allow him to run in 2002 as much against president bush as against 
whomever the state gop nominates in the gubernatorial race in return 
republicans are trying to shift the focus back toward davismost 
aggressively through a californiawide television advertising campaign 
organized by scott reed a former executive director of the republican 
national committee
our goal is to get the focus back to sacramento where it belongs 
reed said
both sides see the same prize in this tug of war the opportunity to 
determine where most californians direct their anger during what could be a 
long hot summer of power shortages
the situation is that the publics minds are not made up on this 
issuewhether it is sacramento or washington who has acted too little too 
late said mark baldassare a pollster at the independent public policy 
institute of california that gives both sides an opportunity to get their 
messages out the stakes are fairly high in terms of how the public in 
california ends up assessing blame over the next few months

a slight uptick in davis popularity
overall davis political situation appears to be stabilizing after 
months of runaway power costs the prices the state pays for wholesale 
electricity are falling and new plants will come online next month and 
following a free fall in private polls davis has seen his numbers tick back 
up slightly similarly a poll financed by independent power generators 
showed that in midjune for the first time in months californians were 
becoming slightly more confident that the crisis is easing
within the state capitol davis is asserting himself demanding that 
lawmakers hold hearings on his rescue plan for southern california edison on 
monday he released details of a similar plan for san diego gas  electric 
last week he announced an agreement that is likely to increase generation by 
alternative energy producers who account for about a fourth of the states 
supply
this guy is changing said state sen steve peace del cajon who a 
few months back had been urging that davis take a more aggressive stance on 
the crisis there is a difference in his demeanor and focus
yet the energy crisis still looms as a vast cloud over a reelection 
campaign that once looked like a stroll on the beach
the paradox for davis is that the substantive victory for pricecontrol 
advocates at the federal energy regulatory commission meeting this week may 
complicate his political goal of maintaining a heavy focus on washington 
though davis and some congressional democrats portrayed fercs decision as 
insufficient it appears to have lanced the pressure for federal legislation 
to impose the tighter price controls that davis supports 
sen dianne feinstein dcalif a principal sponsor of that bill on 
tuesday announced she would shelve the measure for six months to give the new 
ferc plan time to work
as a result the political effect of the ferc ruling could be to shift 
the focus away from washington back toward decisions in sacramento which is 
exactly what republicans prefer gray davis is the dog that finally caught 
the car said dan schnur a san franciscobased gop consultant davis is 
going to keep screaming about price caps and refunds but now republicans can 
point to substantive action

davis much more they should do
for months davis has criticized bush for refusing to support 
electricity price controls and other measures that the governor says could 
ease californias energy crunch at almost every opportunity davis offers 
the same message california is taking the steps it needs to but washington 
has failed to help enough that was precisely davis message monday when ferc 
significantly expanded the limited price caps it had imposed previously
while saying that ferc had finally taken a step in the right 
direction davis added there is much more they should doincluding 
providing refunds to california for alleged overcharges the overall tone of 
davis statement was much more skeptical about fercs action than the remarks 
from feinstein who described the decision as a giant step forward
aides say davis plans to repeat that twopart message in his appearance 
today before the senate governmental affairs committee chaired by sen 
joseph i lieberman dconn in his testimony and in a round of scheduled 
television appearances davis will demand that ferc order refunds in the 
range of 5 billion to 6 billion to the state aides said davis also will 
distribute to every member of congress a 177page book chronicling the 
states response to the crisis
inside the bush white house some officials see in davis cool response 
to fercs decision more evidence that the governor is determined to use the 
white house as a foil in his reelection campaign the prevailing view one 
official said is that no matter what concessions the administration offers 
davis will immediately raise the bar and demand something elsethe way he 
did by talking about rebates as soon as ferc offered tougher price controls
that is davis mo said one official involved in the white houses 
energy strategy he asks the administration to do something the 
administration does it and then he attacks the administration for not doing 
enough    he needs someone to blame
davis aides reject that characterization arguing that the governor is 
merely representing the states interests against an administration that they 
maintain is favoring energy producers over consumers but davis advisors 
acknowledge that they have used focus groups to test campaign messages that 
pin the blame for the energy crunch primarily on davis republican 
predecessor pete wilson and a republican president who has failed to stop 
his rich friends in the energy industry from gouging consumers one aide 
said
you dont have to tell people in focus groups more than once how this 
is connected the davis aide said

gubernatorial rivals are free of blame
baldassare the independent pollster notes it may be especially 
imperative for davis to keep bushs energy decisions in the spotlight because 
none of his potential republican opponents in 2002california secretary of 
state bill jones former los angeles mayor richard riordan or businessman 
william e simon jris easily tagged with complicity in the problem none 
of them were really involved in the decisionmaking over deregulation 
baldassare said the only one else to blame in a political sense is 
washington and the bush administration
the new independent advertising campaign against davis was inspired 
largely by the fear of that strategy succeedingdamaging the standing in 
california not only of bush but also of other republicans particularly those 
in congress reed whose american taxpayers alliance is funding the ads said 
he decided to launch the campaign after davis appeared to gain the upper hand 
in the media debate following bushs visit to california late last month
the bush trip really changed the terms of debate about davis problem 
and made it more of a possible national republican problem reed said the 
entire terms of debate turned around and was focused on the issue of price 
caps as opposed to negligence on davis behalf our group is attempting to go 
out and engage davis
to engage davis reeds group which has not revealed its donors is 
spending what he said would be 15 million on an initial ad criticizing 
davis this week though a spot check of tv stations around the state 
indicated a far more modest buy reed said the group is planning to air a new 
ad as soon as this week
democrats plan to answer the ads with attacks of their own and will be 
filing complaints with the irs and other federal agencies about the anonymous 
funding of the reed ad
todays senate hearing will give davis another chance to respond to the 
gop and make his case for greater help from washington but lieberman aides 
acknowledge the hearing is likely to be much less confrontational than it 
would have been if ferc had not acted monday the agencys decision changed 
the dynamic the aide said
that assessment may apply not only to the conflict between ferc and its 
critics but also equally to the hostilities between davis and the white house

blackout forecasts dark side 
if optimists are wrong and the power runs out californias energy crisis 
could quickly cost lives and cripple the economy 

by jenifer warren times staff writer 

its here summer 2001 the blackout season is only a day away
already californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise by 
august the occasional annoyances endured so farstoplights gone dark 
computers air conditioners and elevators idledcould seem almost quaint
gov gray davis insists we neednt worry four large new power plants 
are firing up soon he said and governments best and brightest are locking 
up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need californians 
davis predicts will valiantly heed his call to conserve helping the state 
survive the hot months no sweat
with luck hell be right power prices have stabilized and some energy 
analysts are wondering whether california may have tamed the blackout beast
but what if those plants dont get built in time people dont trim 
their electricity use 7 and energy imports are more meager than expected
and what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot 
as davis bets but blistering recordsetting hot
government experts who ponder such questions dont expect disaster in 
the coming months but they are planning for it nonetheless
at best they say californians can expect some gridlocked 
intersections an occasionally overloaded 911 system perhaps some business 
bankruptcies certainly inconvenience at worst the western power grid could 
crash causing uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting 
contaminated water supplies even civil unrest
how bad could this summer get said state sen joe dunn dsanta ana 
this summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of california
imagine its a thursday morning in the third week of july relentless 
heat grips california the curse of a stubborn highpressure ridge that just 
wont budge
as air conditioners from redding to chula vista lumber to life managers 
of the states power grid in folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of 
coffee stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret
demand is jumping supply is static canada and arizona have nothing to 
sell its looking tight
thirty minutes later the picture is gloomier a brush fire shuts down 
transmission lines near fresno squeezing supply in the central valley in 
the bay area the unusual heat drives demand well past projections
by noon things look bleak operators of the diablo canyon nuclear power 
plant near san luis obispo have cut output by 80 the trouble chunks of 
kelp have lodged in one of the plants seawater intake valves creating a 
clog like one that plagued the facility in january
with a chorus of groans the grids keepers scour the market for power 
to offset the diablo loss no luck as the mercury climbs and the golden 
state economy roars into full swing electricity consumption ticks upward 
minute by minute and when managers of a power plant near long beach cut 
output because of a cracked turbine everyone knows what it means
alert the utilities its lights out california for the fourth day in 
a row
dr j michael leary dreads blackoutsnot personally but 
professionally leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of 
rancho mirage when air conditioners go on the blink there the 
victimsscores of them mostly old folkswind up in his er
in a normal year 75 of his emergency patients are geriatrics like 
infants the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat when blackouts 
hit they are most at risk
its as if you lived in maine and they turned the heat off in january 
leary said this is an extreme environment we live in the effects can be 
devastating
many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes some 
of them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer 
sun take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking quick
for leary the specter of continual backtoback blackouts in 
julyand some predict in june and august tooconjures images of an 
82yearold man living alone in one of those mobile homes taking medication 
for heart disease the cardiovascular drugs plague the man with numerous side 
effects one inhibits his bodys ability to cool itself
when a person gets overheated body temperature eventually rises 
uncontrollably then comes a nasty spiral of effects and pretty soon you go 
into shock leary said everything just shuts down
on average each year 371 americans die from heatrelated causes more 
than the number killed by earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes lightning and 
floods combined in 1995 a record hot spell in chicago killed 465 people 
eleven californians died from the heat in 1998
a new report by the united seniors assn predicts that more than half a 
million elderly californians could need hospitalization for heatrelated 
ailments this summer 
some communities have laid plans for cooling shelters wading pools and 
other measures to provide relief but will all who need help get it or get 
it in time
out in the desert paramedics expect a crush of 911 calls when the power 
goes out and the ill frail and frightened seek help leary and others at 
eisenhower medical center will be waiting armed with ice packs cooled ivs 
and ventilators
i am very very worried the doctor said i think well see a great 
toll in human suffering even mortality
californias tomato processors are no less anxious they wash cook 
peel chop mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from july to 
octoberenough to account for half the worlds supply for them a string of 
unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days
the reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processinga sterile 
system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plants precise 
temperature is disturbed
once a batch of tomatoes is tainted it must be thrown outall 50000 
pounds the plant must then be sanitized a painstaking process that takes 
about 36 hours
if you get hit by blackouts every third day for say two weeks youre 
starting stopping cleaning restartingits a nightmare said jeff boese 
president of the california league of food processors you could lose three 
batches and be out 40 million before you knew what hit you
meanwhile farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up 
outside the plant waiting to be paid for their crop if we cant process 
them the farmers have spent an entire season growing them for nothing 
boese said
in sonoma county the object in peril is the chicken egg producers 
equip their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens 
comfortable power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eggs
in a blackout those hens can overheat in no time said rich matteis 
of the pacific egg and poultry assn in 20 or 30 minutes you could have 
100000 birds die
many large producers have backup generators but they are not designed 
for ongoing intensive use will they hold up smallscale egg producers 
often have no backup power at all
hundreds of other california businesses could suffer if summer shapes up 
as bad as some predict
the valero refining co of california northeast of san francisco 
produces 115000 barrels of gasoline a day because restarting a refinery is 
a complicated task two or three blackouts close together could prompt 
officials to shutter it until electricity supplies stabilizecosting 
california about 10 of its gasoline supply
at a berkeley medical laboratory doctors say power losses to their 
freezers could destroy bone marrow needed to give young leukemia patients 
lifesaving transplants the states 400 dialysis centers where patients 
without kidney function go to have their blood cleansed every other day are 
in the same fix few have backup generators so when an outage hits 
technicians must crank the machines by hand
most californians of course face far more ordinary consequences the 
scoreboards will fizzle at summer softball games joggers on treadmills will 
be stopped in their tracks electric organs will go silent leaving choirs to 
sing without accompaniment
parents will be asked to retrieve children from daycare centers when 
the lights and cooling systems conk out anniversary lunches may be ruined 
when restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas
most people will tolerate occasional disturbances psychologists say 
doing their part in a time of crisis but what if such irritations become an 
everyday fact of life
hundreds of essential energy usersincluding prisons fire 
departments and airportsare protected from blackouts and hundreds more 
have applied for exemptions that means the pool of people bearing the 
blackout burden is shrinking so more frequent outages are likely
blackout predictions vary widely but at least one forecaster a 
consultant for california water districts anticipates an outage almost every 
afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm
californians are accustomed to trash compactors giantscreen tvs and 
having the internet at their fingertips how much deprivation will they 
tolerate
so far the version of blackouts weve experienced hasnt looked too 
scary to peopleit happens on a workday in the afternoon and you basically 
have to come home and reset your vcr said dan kammen a professor of energy 
and society at uc berkeley
but if outages become daily events and start to invade the evening 
hours the public mood could change abruptly
when theres a disaster or crisis or trauma people tend to act 
heroically and work together said robert butterworth a los angeles 
psychologist and trauma specialist but the civilized behavior only lasts a 
short period then people start acting in unpredictable ways
that tendency may be exacerbated butterworth said by the nature of the 
energy crisisnot a natural disaster but a manmade one
people start to look for a scapegoat he said people will look for a 
target and theres a tendency to strike out at whoever is closest to you
one place that tendency may surface butterworth said is on 
trafficclogged roads blackouts already have led to scores of accidents add 
summer heat to the mix and repeat the pattern day after day at rush hour 
and motorists patience could wear thin law enforcement officials say
were bracing for    possible acts of violence and road rage said 
sacramento county sheriffs lt larry saunders
lon house is the water consultant who predicts california could see 
blackouts almost every summer weekday among the worries for the 440 water 
agencies he represents losing the ability to pump water during wildfire 
season
im telling them to be ready for a major earthquake every day this 
summermeaning all your power is out throughout your district for multiple 
hours house said
house insists he isnt an alarmist but on top of the fire fears he 
warns that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water 
pipes contaminating supplies if that happens californians would be urged 
to boil their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the 
pipe to the other
though rolling blackouts are risky they remain essentially a controlled 
phenomenon occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide 
far more frighteningand devastatingare unexpected cascading outages that 
could shut down the entire western power grid it happened in august 1996 
leaving 4 million people without power during a tripledigit heat wave
the problem began when power lines in oregon sagged into trees and shut 
themselves off that triggered a chain reaction of automatic switchoffs and 
oscillating surges of energy that ultimately shut down all four of the main 
power arteries between california and the pacific northwest
that robbed the system of thousands of megawattsenough to power the 
city of seattle four times overand scattered outages across california and 
six other western states thousands of customers were without power for more 
than a day
though such an episode is rare california grid managers say it is more 
likely today because the system is taxed by the everincreasing load of 
electricity it bears
the system is very dynamic and when its heavily loaded and highly 
stressed like it is now the smallest little thing could cause big trouble 
said kevin bakker who oversees californias connection to the greater 
western power grid 
if a massive uncontrolled outage should hit the ramifications could be 
dizzying said mike guerin chief of law enforcement for the state office of 
emergency services police departments would probably go to tactical alert 
guarding against looting by criminals who might take advantage of disabled 
alarm systems and darkened street lights
in hot areas cities might convert municipal busesparked with air 
conditioners runninginto cooling shelters guerin said the state would 
provide emergency generators to nursing homes and others in need while the 
california national guard might be called into action
with this kind of blackout scenario youre not worried about the 
bologna going bad in the refrigerator guerin said were talking about 
doctors doing surgeries on backup generators for three days were talking 
about a lot of things we dont like to think about

ferc move shortcircuits push for hard price caps 


by richard t cooper and janet hook times staff writers 

washingtonthe federal energy regulatory commissions decision to 
impose fulltime price ceilings on wholesale electricity in california and 
the west appears to have deflated the congressional drive for a return to 
traditional utility regulation
sen dianne feinstein dcalif calling the price mitigation system 
ferc unveiled monday a giant step forward announced tuesday that she is 
pulling back her bill to force a return to the cost of service pricing 
system that prevailed before deregulation republican sen gordon smith of 
oregon a cosponsor agreed as did sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of 
the senate energy committee
house democrats vowed to fight on for tougher controls but they were 
given little chance to succeed
as a result although the political blame game will rage on the reality 
of a long ugly summer for california appears to have arrived at least 
several months of tears toil sweatand fastrising electric bills
california consumers are likely to face an unpleasant paradox energy 
analysts said given present power shortages blackouts are virtually 
inevitable this summer and since state authorities are beginning to let 
high wholesale prices flow through into retail bills after months of 
subsidies many consumers could face higher charges at the same time their 
lights begin to flicker
even if fercs order succeeds and wholesale prices fall as they have 
begun to do in recent weeks consumers bills are likely to rise since 
retail charges lag well behind wholesale prices closing the gap will 
probably mean a period of higher costs for consumers regardless of what 
happens in wholesale markets
there is light at the end of the tunnel energy analysts said but it is 
probably a year away and reaching it they said depends in part on 
government officials taking no action that might spook investors and disrupt 
present plans for expanding the regions capacity to generate and deliver 
more power
the new ferc system which its designers said would provide temporary 
price relief while preserving incentives for energy investment imposes 
costbased curbs on wholesale prices throughout the west and covers all such 
sales not just those during periods of extreme shortages as did the order 
issued in april
ferc chairman curtis l hebert jr told the committee the new system 
will prevent megawatt laundering and other potential abuses he said his 
agency is committed to ferreting out any forms of market misbehavior 24 
hours a day seven days a week
with the apparent collapse of demands for more intervention congress 
now seems ready to give ferc a year or more of leeway to see whether its plan 
will curb wholesale prices and create what ferc member linda breathitt a 
democrat called a breathing spell in which california and the west can 
repair their dysfunctional markets
it still remains to be seen whether there can be manipulation but i 
think we should wait and see feinstein said tuesday at a senate energy 
committee meeting attended by all five ferc members the commissioners call 
their new system price mitigation not price caps but feinstein said it 
amounts to the same thing
whether you call it price mitigation or something else a rose is a 
rose is a rose said feinstein a member of the energy committee
and sen barbara boxer dcalif appearing before the committee as a 
witness said i was very pleased with mondays aboutface by ferc i 
believe they have a new tone
democrats on the other side of the capitol pledged to keep fighting for 
traditional regulation but with republicans in control of the house the 
struggle appears to be largely symbolic
house democrats wanted to introduce amendments on price controls and 
other energy policy to a midyear supplemental appropriation bill due to come 
before the house today however gop leaders expected to block democrats from 
even offering the amendments on procedural grounds
the most sweeping of the amendments would set costbased limits on 
wholesale energy prices in the west rep henry a waxman dlos angeles and 
other sponsors insisted that the measure is still needed in spite of the ferc 
action which he said would continue to provide windfall profits to 
generators encourage suppliers to withhold power and do too little to 
restrain the price of natural gas
he called the ferc policy an experiment that is using california and 
other western states as subjects
similarly rep nancy pelosi dsan francisco said although the ferc 
decision monday is a step in the right direction i am concerned it does 
not remove incentives for energy suppliers to withhold power drive up prices 
and gouge consumers
the commission went as far as it did in part because of the specter of 
broader price control legislation pelosi said they felt the heat they saw 
the amendments coming and decided to act
and rep bob filner dsan diego in an interview tuesday said he will 
press ahead with legislation to impose hard price caps i would advise the 
senators that after a year of dealing with these price gougers that they will 
easily manipulate this latest order he said calling it a swiss cheese 
orderfull of holes 
feinsteins shift put house democrats in an awkward political position 
because it came just as they prepared to make their big push for tougher 
controls but the democrats tried to minimize the differences in legislative 
strategy
she too is waiting to see if the ferc experiment works waxman said 
im a little more skeptical but were both watching carefully
as a political matter a democratic leadership aide acknowledged the 
ferc order muddies the debate at a time when democrats have been working hard 
to make it a defining issueand one they had hoped would help them win 
control of the house in the 2002 elections
its hard to describe to people what the difference is between what we 
want and what ferc has done said the aide
and republicans said fercs action had clearly taken the wind out of the 
sails of price control efforts that some gop strategists feared might have 
passed the house
i would have thought it would pass last week said john feehery 
spokesman for house speaker j dennis hastert rill but now with what 
ferc did it takes a lot of air out of the balloon
i think the ferc action will dissipate that strong push agreed emily 
miller a spokeswoman for house majority whip tom delay rtexas it will 
take the heat off
house majority leader dick armey rtexas said the message to democrats 
was its time to come off your political high horse
he said he wanted to keep democrats from offering their price control 
amendment to wednesdays supplemental appropriation bill because the proposal 
is a political statement not a policy statement

plan wont raise rates davis says 
edison governor seeks to assure senate where democrats say action is a 
bailout of nearly bankrupt utility 

by carl ingram times staff writer 

sacramentogov gray davis sought to assure the state senate on tuesday 
that his plan to save southern california edison from threatened financial 
collapse would work without increasing customer rates
davis sent assurances to the senate energy committee through his top 
attorney barry goode who helped negotiate the controversial proposal with 
the utility
senate republicans have taken a waitandsee attitude on the plan but 
they generally contend that the business of utilities belongs in the hands of 
private enterprise
but democrats in both houses have charged that the deal between democrat 
davis and edison represents a state bailout of the nearly bankrupt 
rosemeadbased utility the analysis is shared by leading consumer activists
at the first in a series of senate hearings on the package which is 
considered all but dead in its current form sen byron sher dpalo alto 
voiced concerns about political problems with the plan
he asked goode who was flanked at a witness table by edison executives 
whether monthly bills of the utilitys customers would increase as a 
consequence of approval of the governors package
our models say there will be no additional impact on the ratepayers 
goode replied
other members appeared ready to pursue rate increase questions but 
chairwoman debra bowen dmarina del rey cut them short she said the issue 
would be fully examined at a later hearing
to spare edison from going into bankruptcy and to restore its 
creditworthiness davis and executives of the utility reached a complex 
compromise in april the centerpiece of which was a state purchase of 
edisons transmission grid for about 28 billion more than twice its book 
value
edison has estimated that it owes 35 billion to creditors including 
wholesale power generators as a result of deregulation of retail electricity 
prices in 1996
because of a freeze in retail rates edison was prohibited from passing 
its energy costs to customers
other features of the deal include dedicating a portion of consumer 
rates to help pay off the debt a guaranteed 116 rate of return to edison 
on its sales and investments and termination of an ongoing public utilities 
commission investigation into financial dealings of edisons parent company 
edison international
the energy committee held the hearing for factfinding purposes and did 
not consider the edison bill sb 78x by sen richard polanco dlos angeles
but the davisedison deal has angered consumer activists who contended 
that bankruptcy for edison would be preferable
they deplored it as a bailout that would cost edison customers 5 
billion to 7 billion
if the legislature makes the mistake of forcing the ratepayers of 
california to pay one more penny to bail out these companies we will put an 
initiative right on the ballot said harvey rosenfield of the foundation 
for taxpayer and consumer rights
consumer organizations in 1998 put to the voters an initiative to junk 
the 1996 deregulation law the measure failed
rosenfield harry snyder of consumers union and matt freedman of the 
utility reform network all asserted at a news conference that the davis 
rescue program should be killed
snyder who opposed deregulation said the governors bill is shaping up 
as a replay of 1996
its too big too complicated    this is the same process that 
brought about this deregulation disaster snyder said
separately san diego gas  electric agreed monday to sell its 
transmission grid to the state for about 1 billion on the same terms as 
edison
with all the controversy surrounding the edison deal the chance of 
sdge winning legislative approval of its sale is slightly better than 50 
said stephen l baum chief executive of sempra energy parent of sdge
i think theres a widely shared view in the legislature that they dont 
want the state in the longterm business of power procurement    in order 
to get edison back into that business there has to be this infusion of 
capital to pay off past electricity debts and make the utility 
creditworthy baum said

state to pay electric bill with loan not taxes 


by miguel bustillo times staff writer 

sacramentocalifornia taxpayers who have had to bankroll billions of 
dollars in electricity purchases for the teetering power utilities will soon 
no longer see their money evaporate at record rates under an executive order 
by gov gray davis
as early as next week the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the state 
budget by allowing treasurer phil angelides to borrow 5 billion to buy 
electricity that money is expected to cover power purchases until this fall 
when the state plans to sell an unprecedented 125 billion in bonds to repay 
the general tax fund and buy future electricity
angelides said tuesday that he has already lined up 35 billion in 
loans from two wall street firms and expects to secure at least another 
billion by next week when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money
the loan is critical he said because without it electricity purchases 
would completely deplete state coffers as early as october
in essence it stops the generalfund bleeding angelides said what 
this interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and 
hopefully avert a cash crisis
the loan could also ease concerns on wall street that californias risky 
entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious 
position those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rating 
agencies downgraded the state earlier this year
we have been looking forward to this day said ray murphy a vice 
president at moodys investors service one of the two firms that downgraded 
californias credit rating we view this as a positive first step toward 
getting the state out of the power business we wanted the state to get the 
general fund out of the business as quickly as possible
california has allocated 82 billion in taxpayer money for electricity 
since january because the states private utilities became too saddled with 
debt to continue purchasing power on the open market and massive blackouts 
loomed
under a plan devised by davis and approved by the legislature the state 
budget is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with the bond 
issue the largest in american history the bonds in turn are to be paid 
off by utility ratepayers through their monthly bills
the bond issue however has been delayed by partisan politics and 
complex legal issues raised by the bankruptcy of pacific gas  electric co 
the states largest private utility
a bond sale initially planned for may is now scheduled for late 
september according to angelides latest estimate the states public 
utilities commission still needs to take a number of technical actions before 
the sale can take place
as a result the state budget has been drained for power purchases far 
longer than initially anticipateda situation that has imperiled spending on 
education transportation and other critical needs at least temporarily
angelides had earlier sought to secure a 4billion bridge loan to repay 
the state budget for power purchases until the bonds were sold but was 
rebuffed by republicans in the legislature who argued that the loan was not 
necessary
davis executive order issued late monday as part of the democratic 
governors emergency powers during the energy crisis gives angelides the 
authority to press ahead
but it does not allow the treasurer to use the loan to repay the budget 
for the billions spent so far this year on electricity as he had originally 
intended rather it permits angelides to use the loan proceeds to assist the 
department of water resources the state agency buying power with its future 
electricity expenses
if the bond issue is further delayed angelides estimated the loan 
would gives california another four to six months before it would begin to 
run out of money furthermore the loan closes a potential loophole that 
existed in the longterm contracts davis had signed to stabilize the cost of 
electricity which would have let power suppliers walk away from the deals if 
the state had not secured a source of financing by next month
but republicans warned that by entering into a bridge loan deal without 
knowing when the bonds would be sold davis and the democrats were incurring 
major risks that could further drive up the price tag of the crisis
the loan carries a blended interest rate of about 45 but if it is not 
repaid by oct 31 the rate jumps to 7 because the loan is to be repaid by 
the bonds which have been marred by a history of delay gop officials 
tuesday were already calling the bridge loan a bridge to nowhere
the thing that is most troubling is that the governor did not bother to 
consult with anyone said assembly republican leader dave cox rfair oaks 
who learned of davis order from reporters its disappointing but the 
governor does not seem to recognize there is a legislative branch

edison unveils blackout warning plan 
technology the utility will notify customers by internet and telephone when 
power might go out 

by daniel hernandez times staff writer

southern california edison on tuesday unveiled a system that will 
forecast coming blackouts over the internet and by telephone 
ordered by the state to create a warning system for customers as 
california enters a summer that will almost certainly include rotating 
blackouts edison is also preparing to use automatic phone calls faxes and 
wireless communications to alert subscribers to outages 
with these steps edison is complying with an order by the state public 
utilities commission which in april told the company to notify customers of 
coming outages privately held pacific gas and electric co established a 
similar program months ago 
edison previously opposed a notification system arguing that such a 
system could incite looters and burglars but police agencies including the 
los angeles county sheriffs department saw more danger in not warning 
customers said richard rosenblum an edison senior vice president
on balance we concluded it was preferable for public safety to make 
that information available rosenblum said
consumer advocates said edisons notification system is welcome if 
tardy
its fair to say that edison has been a little behind where pge has 
been in trying to implement this said mike florio an attorney with the 
utility reform network and a member of the california independent system 
operator board which runs the state power grid
edisons web site  now features a popup screen that warns 
of any blackouts coming in the next hour it also links to a page which can 
be reached at  that forecasts which outage groups will 
be cut off next in the event of rotating blackouts detailed maps outline 
which areas are included in each group 
the new web features are expected to handle about 4 million simultaneous 
users beginning this month edison customers also can learn their block 
number by looking at their bills said edison spokesman gil alexander
outage information also will be made available on an automated phone 
line 800 6111911
edison officials are negotiating with another company to provide 
additional warnings by email fax phone and wireless communications sdge 
which like edison was required to inform customers of outage forecasts has 
moved more quickly providing large industrial customers with blackout 
notification via pager since june 4
uptotheminute outage reports also will be provided in several 
languages to radio and tv stations edison officials said
edison officials emphasized that the new alert system can never be 100 
accurate and that sudden blackouts although rare are always a possibility 
we have planned as aggressively as we think is warranted understanding 
that you cant predict how your customers will respond alexander said

state joins challenge to bush on airconditioner standards 
regulations us rolled back clinton rule from 30 increase in efficiency to 
20 on manufacturers urging 

by jenifer warren times staff writer 

california and two other states joined environmentalists tuesday in 
suing the bush administration over its decision to weaken efficiency 
standards for home air conditioners
the lawsuit caps weeks of criticism heaped on the administration after 
it rolled back a rule requiring manufacturers to increase the efficiency of 
air conditioners 30 by 2006
that rule was adopted by president clinton during his final days in 
office and after years of research and debate california and other 
statesincluding texasendorsed it as a way to substantially cut energy use 
and improve air quality
but after reviewing the rule at the industrys behest bush 
administration officials in april sliced the mandated increase to 20 the 
higher standard they said would have made home coolers too expensive 
especially for the poor
conservationists and consumer groups blasted the policy change calling 
it shortsighted at a time when california and other states are enduring an 
energy crunch
in california residential airconditioning accounts for about 15 of 
the peak energy demand weakening efficiency standards critics say will 
require as many as 60 new power plants nationwide four in california
this is a time when we need to conserve electricity and reduce our 
dependence on the large energy generators and importers state atty gen 
bill lockyer said in an interview weakening this standard is precisely the 
wrong message at precisely the wrong time
in their lawsuit lockyer and the attorneys general of new york and 
connecticut allege that federal law bars the us department of energy from 
softening an appliance efficiency standard a separate but similar suit was 
filed by the natural resources defense council the consumer federation of 
america and another nonprofit group
joe davis the energy departments deputy spokesman said there would be 
no immediate comment on the suit filed in federal court in manhattan he 
added however that we believe all of the actions of our decisionmaking in 
the air conditioner standards are well within the law
when clintons rule was issued in january his outgoing energy 
secretary bill richardson said the payoff in power savings and cleaner air 
would be one of the administrations greatest environmental achievements
but a trade association representing air conditioner manufacturers 
challenged the new rule arguing that it would dramatically increase costs of 
the unitspriced between 2000 and 4000and thus discourage people from 
replacing old ones
the department of energy sided with the industry group in april 
officials said clintons proposal would have added 335 to the price of a new 
air conditioner while the lower 20 standard would boost prices only about 
213
others however say those figures do not take into account the 
economies of scale gained when manufacturers increase production of the more 
efficient units when congress passed the first efficiency standard for air 
conditioners in the late 1980s industry said the sky was falling and that 
it would increase the cost of air conditioners by 700 said andrew delaski 
executive director of the nonprofit appliance standards awareness project in 
fact he said us department of commerce data showed no price jump
dan reicher the assistant secretary of energy under clinton who oversaw 
development of the stricter standards added that highefficiency air 
conditioners are not some exotic untested technology
there are lots and lots of air conditioners already meeting the 
standardsbetween 5 and 10 of the units sold today he said
although most manufacturers support the bush rollback the second 
largest maker of air conditionershoustonbased goodman global holding 
which produces the amana brandopposes it saying any higher upfront costs 
would be recovered by consumers in lower utility bills
on tuesday the companys president john goodman issued a statement 
supporting the lawsuit saying the tougher standard would give consumers an 
enormous cost saving us energy consumption will drop and our environment 
will benefit from reduced air pollutant emissions and greenhouse gases

new price caps not a deterrent power firms say 
regulation producers are unhappy with the federal action but say it is 
unlikely to discourage them from constructing new plants 

by nancy vogel and thomas s mulligan times staff writers 

the expanded electricity price limits approved by federal regulators 
could squeeze big energy traders but will probably not discourage power plant 
construction in california electricity producers said tuesday
power plant owners and marketers said they had not had time to digest 
the 53page order and thus could not say exactly how it would affect 
california and the 10 other western states it covers
but the companies generally asserted tuesday that the order would not 
deter them from investing in the vast powerstarved western regionthough 
they have often raised such a prospect in arguing against price controls
whatever its longterm effects mondays order by the federal energy 
regulatory commission appeared to have an immediate effect in dampening 
prices in californias volatile daily or spot market
the order does not take effect until today but the prospect of new 
measures aimed at limiting prices appeared to tame markets tuesday 
californians used more electricity at the lateafternoon peak than on any day 
this year yet market prices hovered around 100 a megawatthour
that is well below the average of 284 a megawatthour that the state 
paid for electricity from january through april with prices soaring as high 
as 1900 at times of tight supply
all the markets in the west have come down said mike wilczek senior 
power markets reporter for platts the energy market information division of 
the mcgrawhill cos its bearish news
nevertheless several generators minimized the effects of the ferc 
order contradicting earlier warnings from some industry sources and 
officials of the bush administration who consider price limits to be 
impediments to future investment in power plants
calpine will have no problem operating under this order said joe 
ronan vice president of regulatory affairs for san josebased calpine corp 
which has three power plants under construction in california and plans to 
build at least three others
the federal order lasts only until september 2002 he said and because 
it sets prices based on the cost of running the most expensive inefficient 
power plant in the market it should guarantee the owners of modern plants a 
profit
another company planning major investments in california duke energy 
corp of north carolina said it will not be seriously affected by the 
federal order because it has sold the output of its four california plants 
well into the future
weve already forwardsold 90 of our generation for 2001 and 70 for 
2002 company spokesman pat mullen said
reliant energy inc of houston which owns five power plants in 
california was not so sanguine about the federal order but it has not 
backed away from plans to install more generators
we remain committed to california as hard as it is to do business here 
today spokesman richard wheatley said we have plans that are on the 
drawing boards for at least one possibly two projects
on monday reliant chief executive joe bob perkins called the ferc 
action more of a political response than an acknowledgment of the gap 
between electricity supply and demand in california
price caps dont work perkins said and he warned california 
consumers against assuming that the energy crisis is over simply because 
wholesale electricity prices have recently dropped to their lowest levels in 
a year
prices are falling because of mild weather not price controls he said
without sound economics that increase available supply and reduce peak 
demand    consumers can only hope for favorable weather and look forward 
to rolling blackouts perkins said
energy analyst frederick schultz of raymond james  associates in 
houston called the ferc order a nonevent to the california generators 
because so much of their power is now being sold through longterm contracts
however every longterm deal reduces the size of the electricity 
market which supplies about 20 of californias needs and that in turn 
limits trading opportunities for such firms as enron corp which profit on 
the daily markets ups and downs schultz said
enron representatives did not respond to calls for comment
the federal order imposes roundtheclock price curbs on wholesale 
electricity sold in 11 western states that are connected by transmission 
grids
under the order traders say market prices will probably hover around 
100 a megawatthour depending upon the price of the natural gas that fuels 
most of the states electric generating plants though that is well below 
recent market prices it is higher than the average of about 32 a 
megawatthour that california utilities paid in 1999 before the states 
deregulated market spiraled out of control
the ferc order dictates that the price for spot market electricity 
across the west will be based on the cost of producing one megawatthour of 
power at the leastefficient plant selling to california grid operators may 
31 when a previous ferc order based on a similar formula took effect the 
price set was 127 a megawatthour

the fercs action is good badugly 
by peter navarro


the federal energy regulatory commissions new wholesale price caps will 
save the western states literally tens of billions of dollars in electricity 
bills as wonderful as that sounds the ferc order still allows wholesale 
generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into 
recession 
the fercs approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and 
natural gas shortages 
lets look at what the ferc did right first the order approved monday 
establishes price caps on a 247 basis rather than simply during power 
emergenciesa long overdue reform 
second the order protects the entire west not just california this 
regional cap will end megawatt laundering whereby instate generators sold 
power across california lines and then resold it back into the state to evade 
caps 
third the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the 
fercs previous price caps swiss cheese before generators could redirect 
their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the price 
caps 
so where did the ferc go wrong the problem may be traced to the two 
competing methods of imposing price caps and the allimportant concept of 
economic rent 
economic rent in the wholesale electricity market is the market price 
of electricity minus the producers cost where cost includes not just labor 
and fuel but a fair profit on the invested capital as well in traditional 
regulation this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost of 
the money borrowed to build the power plant 
under this definition if the producers cost is a nickel a kilowatt 
hour and he can sell it for 35 centsas producers in the west have been 
doingthe producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers 
in california the extraction of such economic rent through market 
manipulation has taken place on a grandtheft scale in 1999 californias 
electricity bill was about 7 billion last year it was almost 30 billion 
for roughly the same amount of electricity this year californias bill is 
well on its way to 50 billion annually 
to stop this ripoff gov gray davis proposed costbased price caps 
such caps are calculated on a plantspecific basis each generator is allowed 
to recover its cost of production including the fair profit but not a penny 
more 
thus for example a newer highly efficient plant generating power at a 
nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel the oldest least efficient 
plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cents 
by setting different prices for different plants the economic rents are 
driven to zero yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to 
produce from a public policy perspective its the best of all possible 
worlds and it was categorically rejected by the ferc instead the ferc sets 
a single price for all generators based on the cost of the least efficient 
plant 
the obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still 
allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers 
in our previous example and under the fercs rule the least efficient 
plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs however the most 
efficient plant producing power at a nickelperkilowatt also collects 20 
cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic 
rent 
thus under the fercs rule wholesale generators still will be able to 
capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than 
under davis costbased rule 
the fercs approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic 
gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis generators will ensure that 
during peak times when the price cap is being established the most 
expensive possible plant is in operationwhether it needs to be or not this 
will peg the price at the highest level 
in addition the ferc provides generators with a perverse incentive to 
run their least efficient units more often since these least efficient 
plants are also the highest polluting the result will be dirtier air 
moreover the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on 
already stretched natural gas supplies these least efficient plants use up 
to 40 more natural gas to produce a unit of electricity 
the bottom line the ferc done good but it could have done a lot 
better and the way things stand now there still is a danger that higher 
electricity costs could push california and the rest of the westand 
eventually the nationinto a nasty recession

davis oks stopgap loan 
crisis powers action sidesteps legislature 
greg lucas sacramento bureau chief
wednesday june 20 2001 
2001 san francisco chronicle 
url  
circumventing the legislature gov gray davis used his emergency powers 
yesterday to authorize borrowing up to 5 billion for energy purchases in 
advance of a record bond issue 
sidestepping the legislature with a stroke of the pen davis action 
indicates that the state may need more time to prepare a 125 billion bond 
issue this fall the largest sale of its kind in history 
the democratic governors action was swiftly assailed by the republican 
leadership 
this is not a dictatorship its a democracy said assembly gop leader dave 
cox of carmichael there is a judiciary a legislative side and an executive 
side and everyone has roles and responsibilities yet we continue to have 
the governor say im the only one around here that makes any difference 
the rest of you shall do my bidding  
normally it is the legislature that has the power to raise and spend money 
and a governor may not spend a cent unless lawmakers allow him to 
but davis has broad powers under the state of emergency which he declared in 
january to combat californias energy crisis 
no advance notice
the governors aides declined to comment on yesterdays executive order and 
gave no advance notice of it 
this executive order authorizing a bridge loan will allow us to get 
californias general fund out of the powerbuying business was the 
governors only comment in a written statement issued last night 
state treasurer phil angelides said lawyers had advised him and the governor 
that such borrowing could be authorized by an executive order 
the loan from wall street will temporarily fill the 52 billion  and 
growing  hole in the state budget created when the state began buying 
electricity on behalf of the states cashstarved utilities in january 
the idea is to tide the state over until a larger bond sale of 125 billion 
can be arranged later this year a portion of that sale will pay back the 
52 billion borrowed from wall street 
stops the bleeding 
it stops the general fund bleeding said angelides it takes the pressure 
off and hopefully well avert a cash crisis 
the state runs out of internal borrowing power sometime in october angelides 
said the loan would buy the state another four to six months 
the idea of a loan was floated earlier this year 
cox and other gop lawmakers objected wondering why the state should pay 
interest on borrowed money when it could still borrow from various accounts 
within the state budget 
they refused to vote for a bill authorizing the larger bond sale of 125 
billion forcing a delay in issuing it until at least aug 14 
the idea of borrowing from wall street appears to have been abandoned since 
both davis administration and legislative budgetwriters said the state could 
keep borrowing internally into october well after the bond sale 
yesterdays executive order authorizing the borrowing suggests that neither 
angelides nor davis are confident that the steps needed to prepare the 125 
billion bond issue for market can be completed before then 
angelides had previously said he hoped to sell the bonds in early september 
yesterday he said the governors hope is to still sell longterm bonds by 
sept 30 
act of desperation
sen tom mcclintock rnorthridge described the executive order as an act of 
desperation that would suggest they are expecting the large bond sale to 
occur later rather than sooner 
numerous actions must be completed before the bond sale 
among them are the approval by the public utilities commission of several 
deals with the state and utilities to ensure that enough money from 
consumers flows back to bond buyers to pay off interest and principal 
although davis executive order authorizes 5 billion in loans angelides has 
only lined up 35 billion 
so far only two lenders have come forward to offer the state a loan jp 
morgan with 25 billion and lehman brothers with 1 billion at an interest 
rate of 45 percent if the longterm bonds are not sold by oct 31 that 
will increase to 7 percent 
angelides said he hoped to line up another 1 billion by next week when the 
loan deal occurs 
assuming a loan of 45 billion angelides said the state would pay out 8 
million in fees

experts say state must seize the day 
analysis price caps set stage for future 
david lazarus chronicle staff writer
wednesday june 20 2001 
2001 san francisco chronicle 
url  
one day after federal authorities ordered longsought electricity price caps 
throughout the west analysts said yesterday it is up to california to 
respond with measures to bring an end to the states long frustrating 
experiment with deregulation 
possible steps the experts point to include raising power bills easing 
pollution controls and spending billions of dollars in taxpayers money on 
new plants 
gov gray davis and his team have been making this up week by week said 
paul joskow director of the center for energy and environmental policy 
research at the massachusetts institute of technology 
its time for them to get together with the federal energy regulatory 
commission ferc to come up with some solutions he said the state needs 
to get down to business and decide how the power market is going to look 18 
months from now 
easier said than done to date californias strategy for tackling its energy 
woes largely has consisted of wheedling cajoling and all but begging federal 
officials to come to the rescue 
now that the federal regulators have gone much of the way toward granting the 
states wishes analysts said davis and other officials must act swiftly and 
decisively to further remedy californias prolonged power troubles 
for his part however the governor feels that federal regulators have not 
done enough he will push today during congressional hearings in washington 
for billions of dollars in refunds for california ratepayers 
ferc has taken some first steps but the proverbial fat lady hasnt sung 
said steve maviglio a spokesman for davis 
this persistent focus on federal assistance could slow progress toward a 
lasting solution to californias problems some analysts believe 
we are still likely to experience blackouts this summer said michael 
zenker director of cambridge energy research associates in oakland its 
not yet clear that the state will do what it can to address other aspects of 
the problem 
put simply such steps would require enormous political courage  and would 
be very expensive in the end taxpayers and ratepayers will bear the burden 
for this prolonged fiasco 
among measures under consideration 
 raising electricity rates even higher although californians got the 
largest rate increase in state history last month even higher charges would 
promote conservation and lessen the need for california to borrow billions of 
dollars in the bond market 
 loosening emissions restrictions for power plants statewide this would 
provide more electricity during shortages but turn back the clock on 
californias strict environmental standards 
 building new plants at taxpayers expense this would guarantee a steady 
supply of juice but would leave the state struggling for years to recoup the 
huge investment costs 
of the three easing pollution controls is the easiest first step and the 
most likely analysts said such environmental protections have been roundly 
criticized by power industry officials who claim the restrictions have 
hampered the construction of new generating plants 
taxpayerfinanced power plants are possible under a new state power authority 
backed by the governor but the timing and financing remain undecided 
higher electricity rates could be the toughest move to make analysts agree 
they note that davis will seek reelection next year and doesnt want to be 
seen as the governor who sent voters power bills into the stratosphere 
already critics are trying to paint him as the governor who was asleep at 
the power switch 
as federal regulators were moving at last on the pricecap front this week 
another big development took place closer to home monday when davis disclosed 
a tentative deal with sempra energys san diego gas  electric co the plan 
calls for the state to purchase the utilitys 1800 miles of power lines for 
nearly 1 billion 
as with a similar accord reached with southern california edison the sempra 
deal is intended to counter the catastrophic effects of california having 
deregulated wholesale power prices but not allowing the states utilities to 
pass on costs to customers 
between them californias three major utilities have rung up more than 15 
billion in debt 
here too the state appears unsure how to proceed both the sempra and 
edison agreements require approval from the legislature its anyones guess 
whether such approval is forthcoming 
its going to be a really really tough sell said nettie hoge executive 
director of the utility reform network in san francisco these arent 
fabulous deals 
one scenario for utilities
rather she believes the agreements will be reworked so that less taxpayer 
money changes hands while allowing the utilities to retain possession of 
their power systems 
hoge said this could subsequently influence a speedy resolution of pacific 
gas and electric cos bankruptcy proceedings if it can avoid selling off 
key assets like power lines pge may be more open to any settlement plans 
put forward by the state 
the utilities are all going to end up with similar deals hoge forecast 
state senate president pro tem john burton dsan francisco isnt so sure 
he observed that the edison deal hinges on a sale of the utilitys power 
lines to the state while the sempra accord could stand even without such a 
transaction 
the two deals are totally unrelated burton said adding that approval of 
the edison accord is very much in flux a bankruptcy filing by the states 
secondlargest utility remains a distinct possibility he said 
this would only increase the importance of price caps in bringing some 
stability back to californias power market 
while the states current rate freeze will continue cushioning consumers from 
the volatility of wholesale electricity prices the caps  or price 
mitigation as federal regulators are calling it  will limit the amount 
that power generators can charge on the open market 
system has flaws
it is not a perfect system power companies can base prices on the cost of 
running the leastefficient  and thus costliest  generating facility but 
this amount almost certainly will be below some of the more outrageous prices 
seen when the sky was the limit 
on at least one occasion this year californias wholesale power price topped 
3000 per megawatt hour compared with just 30 about a year ago 
this is a plan that is good for california good for the pacific northwest 
and good for the entire west said ferc chairman curt hebert 
that remains to be seen as it stands the price caps will remain in effect 
through next summer

californias energy crisis hits northwest like a tidal wave 
jeff hammarlund
wednesday june 20 2001 
2001 san francisco chronicle

d165509dtl 
there was a time when many northwesterners thought we could watch 
californias energy crisis from a safe distance 
we have since learned that a major energy crisis does not stop at the golden 
states borders but instead rolls over the northwest like a tidal wave 
wreaking havoc with our economy and overwhelming our carefully crafted energy 
policies 
as one northwest utility official put it we learned that everyone else is 
the tail california is the dog 
to understand why the northwest is now facing its own energy crisis and how 
the energy problems in the northwest and california each affect each other 
one must understand how the northwest gets its power 
in the northwest falling water is our primary fuel depending on the 
available snowpack hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the 
columbia river basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the regions 
electricity about twothirds of this hydropower comes from 29 dams owned and 
operated by the two federal agencies the us army corps of engineers and 
the bureau of reclamation 
by taking advantage of the regions geography and climate the columbias 
hydroelectric dams have produced some of the least expensive electricity in 
the nation power that has been the economic backbone of the region 
however the columbias hydrosystem also has two curses 
one is that water conditions can vary greatly and right now the northwest 
and california are in the middle of an extreme drought the second is the 
dams negative impact on salmon these dams operate under a federal salmon 
recovery plan established under the endangered species act that calls for 
more water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream 
instead of through the dams powergenerating turbines 
that power is sold at cost and transmitted to northwest consumerowned 
utilities by yet another federal agency called the bonneville power 
administration these costbased rates cover the expense of repaying the 
us 
treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects moving the 
power over massive transmission lines and supporting efforts to restore the 
dwindling salmon runs 
under federal law northwest consumers get preferred access to the relatively 
lowcost power any surplus power can be sold most often to californias 
municipal and investorowned utilities 
this northwest regional preference to federal power was part of the deal 
that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines called the 
intertie which first connected the northwest with california and the 
southwest in the late 1960s 
for decades the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyones benefit 
during the summer when air conditioners caused californias power use to 
peak many california utilities would supplement their needs by turning to 
the northwest in the winter when northwest electric furnaces are turned on 
for space heating california utilities would return the favor and ship their 
surplus power north 
recently the bpa has had to purchase large blocs of power on the wholesale 
market to meet its contractual obligations to its northwest customers 
the same exorbitant wholesale prices that began to plague california last 
year have also affected the northwest meaning that the bpa has been running 
out of money and is now in danger of defaulting on its debt obligations to 
the treasury 
californias deregulation plan has affected energy relations between the two 
regions in other ways for example the bpa has historically sold surplus 
power to california for relatively low prices however the states 
deregulation law made it almost impossible for california utilities to enter 
into favorable longterm contracts 
instead power had to be purchased at the much higher market clearing price 
on the shortterm spot market 
the bpa has taken extraordinary steps to help california keep the lights on 
at times the agency even declared energy emergencies which allowed it to 
temporarily override salmon protections and use the water to generate power 
for california rather than sweep salmon over the dams california officials 
have praised the bpa for its cooperation but northwest environmentalists and 
tribal leaders complain that the bpa has been helping california address its 
energy crisis by selling salmon down the river 
the northwest will be helped by fercs decision yesterday to extend limited 
temporary price restrictions it had imposed in california in the spring to 
other western states during severe shortages the order should also be good 
for california without consistent price restrictions throughout the west 
power marketers would simply skip california during an emergency and sell at 
higher prices elsewhere 
but not everyone is happy with the decision many critics say the rates are 
still too high and some critics said in s published report that the order 
rewards inefficiency by pegging price ceilings to the costliest california 
gas plants 
the halfhearted response from ferc along with continuing supply shortages 
and other problems make it likely that california will continue to face 
rolling blackouts and high utility bills  even though they may not be as 
high as we once feared 
the northwest may follow suit next winter 
some in our region fear that some desperate california political leaders 
might try to wrest control of the bpa and a large portion of the columbia 
basins hydropower the 6600 megawatts of hydropower from the columbias 
federal dams would only offer a few drops in the bucket for californias 
massive 50000megawatt system but its loss would devastate the northwest 
economy 
the four northwest governors of washington oregon idaho and montana and 
more than 40 state legislators met in february and agreed to explore ways to 
ensure that the northwest does not lose its regional preference to the 
columbias hydropower 
northwest governors have had some productive meetings with gov gray davis 
and his staff this year regarding power sharing and there are encouraging 
signs that trust is growing at this and other levels 
just last week officials from the bpa californias department of water 
resources and the california iso agreed on a plan that outlines when and how 
the bpa may be able to help california during the expected summer shortages 
we will soon find out whether our two regions will succeed in collaborating 
with or cannibalizing each other as we enter the next phase of the west coast 
energy crisis 
ultimately californias experience with energy deregulation makes the case 
for a strong and supportive federal role in the energy markets it also 
reinforces the view that electricity should be treated as an essential 
service and be sold at cost by utilities that are owned and controlled by the 
public rather than as a commodity and sold at the highest price 
in fact something like a california power authority that places california 
in charge of its own destiny makes more sense to me all the time

davis demands nearly 9 billion for electricity overcharges

0620 0803 pdt washington ap  
california gov gray davis demanded that power generators refund nearly 9 
billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators 
have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state 
davis told a senate hearing wednesday that the decision by the federal energy 
regulatory commission to curtail price spikes in california and 10 other 
western states was a step forward but its actions do nothing about the 
overcharges over the past year he said 
the governor a democrat has been criticized by republicans who charge he 
has allowed the california power crisis to get out of hand 
davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new 
power plants and strengthened conservation programs he also said the state 
has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators 
the governor once said he could solve californias problems in 15 minutes 
 but it appears that california has continued to try and hide the true 
cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities 
putting california taxpayers in jeopardy said sen frank murkowski 
ralaska 
murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities 
not under ferc jurisdiction 
sen joe lieberman dconn chairman of the governmental affairs committee 
said the ferc which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to 
respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are 
just and reasonable as required by the 1934 federal power act 
the agencys response to the western power problem raises serious questions 
about whether ferc has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy 
markets not only in the west but across the rest of the country 
the federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day 
imposed limited marketbased price caps on monday in california and 10 other 
western states from washington to arizona the agency also ordered the 
parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on 
overcharges and other issues 
months ago the ferc singled out 124 million in alleged overcharges by power 
generators the power companies have since challenged the agencys findings 
and the matter remains in dispute 
to date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to california 
complained davis he said that between may 2000 and the beginning of this 
month power generators are believed to have overcharged california 89 
billion 
they must be required to give us back our money said davis it is 
unconscionable that ferc looked the other way while energy companies bilked 
our state for up to 9 billion 
the state spent 7 billion for electricity in 1999 and 27 billion in 2000 
and is projected to pay nearly 50 billion this year said davis power 
generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he 
said 
davis rejected republican criticism that the state is not addressing the 
problem he said newly approved power plants will provide 20000 additional 
megawatts of electricity by 2003 including 4000 megawatts by the end of 
this summer everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable 
energy to california is being done  except wholesale price relief he 
said 
this administration has minimized this crisis for more months said sen 
patty murray dwash alluding to president bushs repeated refusal to urge 
the ferc to mitigate electricity prices bush has strongly opposed price 
controls although he indicated support for fercs limited price mitigation 
effort this week 
murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that 
businesses can get lowincome loans and require that ferc press its 
investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in california 
but in the pacific northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed 
republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on 
the cost of generation at individual power plants 
having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price 
is laughable said sen fred thompson of tennessee the committees ranking 
republican hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem  they 
make a bad situation worse he said 
after ferc issued its limited price control order this week senate democrats 
on tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent 
costbased price caps on western electricity sales 
democrats in the house however said they would continue to pursue a bill 
requiring the ferc to take more aggressive action

washington  with federal regulators moving to cap prices on wholesale 
electricity californias dianne feinstein and other senate democrats 
yesterday withdrew their threat to do it for them 
a rose is a rose by any other name feinstein declared to the five members 
of the federal energy regulatory commission the day after they unanimously 
imposed a sweeping price ceiling on electricity throughout eleven western 
states 
im very grateful feinstein told the commissioners who were called to 
testify to the senate energy and natural resources committee lets watch 
and wait and see how this order works 
feinstein had been leading the democratic charge in washington to force ferc 
to impose price controls indeed yesterdays hearing had been intended to 
highlight the agencys inaction gov gray davis is still billed to appear 
today at another senate panel headed by sen joe lieberman dconn to 
investigate price gouging 
the 60page ferc order which takes effect at midnight tonight and remains 
until september 2002 limits prices based on the cost of the leastefficient 
and therefore highestcost generating plant it is intended to mimic the way 
a competitive market functions 
while democrats hailed fercs move power generators and marketers warned 
that it would backfire leading to more blackouts and stifling investment in 
new power plants 
it doesnt create or conserve a single megawatt in california or the west  
said enron spokesman mark palmer government price controls always have 
unintended consequences and history has proven that those have never been 
good for consumers 
joe bob perkins president and chief operating officer of reliant energy 
bluntly called the price caps a political response to californias crisis 
that ignores the basics of supply and demand 
price caps dont work perkins said in a statement this fact has been 
proven over and over in the context of virtually every business sector in 
which government regulators have experimented with such measures 
the bush administration which has fought electricity price caps since taking 
office in january yesterday insisted that ferc had actually spurned them 
its important to note that ferc rejected price controls said white house 
spokesman ari fleischer who instead called it a marketbased mitigation 
plan 
he added the order is in keeping with the presidents desire to help the 
state of california and to make certain that there is no illegal price 
gouging carried on by any companies 
fercs action coincided with the arrival of two new bush appointees to the 
agency patrick henry wood iii a former texas utility regulator and nora 
mead brownell a former pennsylvania regulator 
the softspoken boyishlooking wood yesterday sought to allay feinsteins 
lingering concerns that the new price control scheme would still permit 
generators to manipulate the market 
feinsteins bill would have gone further than the new ferc plan imposing a 
costofservice based price cap that would return california to the 
regulatory regime it had before its 1996 electricity restructuring 
i am personally not allergic to that sort of remedy wood told the panel  
 a position that is toxic to the bush administrations former opposition to 
price caps the costofservice regime was good enough for 80 years wood 
said were trying to move away from it but we can still do it 
fercs action followed by feinsteins bill withdrawal quickly defused a 
mounting political confrontation between the bush white house and democrats 
over price caps  one that saw capitol hill republicans beating a retreat 
democrats argued that bush by refusing to impose price controls was 
allowing outofstate generators based mostly in texas to gouge california 
consumers 
the administration especially vice president dick cheney and energy 
secretary spencer abraham had insisted that price controls would backfire by 
reducing electricity sales and power plant investment making the states 
blackouts worse 
yesterday sen gordon smith an oregon republican who cosponsored 
feinsteins bill as much as said the white house would have lost the fight 
smith said their measure would have won large majorities in both the senate 
and house had it gone to a vote

potrero hill power plant hit by 2 lawsuits 
neighbors city ask court to cut back hours of operation

the san francisco city attorney joined forces with environmental and 
community groups and sued in federal court yesterday to force the operator of 
the potrero hill power plant to cut its rampedup electricity output until 
more rigorous pollution controls are installed 
the plant run by mirant corp increased its output in response to gov gray 
davis move to relax environmental laws on power producers and generate more 
electricity for californians 
the lawsuits filed against mirant in us district court allege the company 
is illegally operating its socalled peaker plants the suits appear to be 
the first challenge in california to davis efforts to produce more power 
the potrero hill plant which runs during times of peak demand has a total 
of six turbines that generate 156 megawatts of electricity enough to power 
156000 homes each turbine is permitted to operate 877 hours a year  a 
threshold that already has been exceeded 
mirant struck a deal march 30 with administrators of the bay area air quality 
management district  the regional agency that regulates air pollution  to 
run the plants as much as needed to keep up with the energy demand in 
return mirant will pay 20000 per ton of excess emissions of nitrogen 
oxides a pollutant that causes smog the company placed 400000 on deposit 
the mirant corporation is behaving like an outlaw and the air district is 
their willing accomplice in violating clean air laws said mike thomas an 
organizer with communities for a better environment one of the plaintiffs 
the other groups that sued are bayviewhunters point community advocates and 
our childrens earth 
the city filed a separate suit over the same issue 
the lawsuits ask the court to order mirant to stop operating beyond the 877 
hour cap until it obtains new permits the city and environmental groups 
argue the permits for expanded operation are required by the federal clean 
air act 
the lawsuits also demand that more stringent pollution controls be installed 
on the peakers the increased power production poses a potentially serious 
health risk to the people who live and work in the surrounding neighborhood 
the plaintiffs charge 
because the peaker plants werent originally intended to run full time they 
arent equipped with the most uptodate pollution controls 
the plaintiffs also allege the air district regulators violated the 
california environmental quality act by failing to conduct thorough reviews 
of the expanded operation and not allowing for public comment 
we as a city are not saying no to power were saying theres a process and 
they need to follow it said san francisco supervisor sophie maxwell who 
represents district 10 where the power plant is located 
terry lee a spokesman for the air district said her agency and mirant did 
nothing illegal mirant spokesman patrick dorinson concurred 
they pointed to davis executive orders earlier this year that gave power 
companies the right to step up production without going through the normal 
permit process and adhering to the stricter pollution controls 
william rostov an attorney for communities for a better environment 
contends davis does not have authority to override federal air quality laws 
lee said the us environmental protection agency signed off on the 
governors plan 
the plant near 23rd and illinois streets long has been a target of 
neighbors trying to close it mirant is hoping to build a new 540megawatt 
plant on the site that uses cleanerburning natural gas the existing plant 
burns highly polluting distillate oil 
lee said the money mirant is paying for the extra emissions will help reduce 
air pollution in potrero hill the efforts include placing filters on muni 
diesel fuel buses that operate in the neighborhood and installing a lower 
polluting engine on a tug boat that runs off the nearby shores 
is this a perfect situation no lee said but under the governors 
executive orders this is the way were proceeding

washington wakes up 

wednesday june 20 2001 
2001 san francisco chronicle 
url 

d40132dtl 
washington after all does feel our pain partial but reasonable price 
controls will contain wholesale electricity prices beginning today under a 
longsought ruling by the federal energy regulatory commission its about 
time 
where was this agency until now and why the sudden willingness to help 
politics 
at first the bush administration denounced controls as market interference 
that would chase off investment in power generation 
but the peril has spread beyond california to other western states whose 
governors are republicans midterm elections for congress are coming up next 
year also the white house was besieged by california republicans and 
business groups worried about blackouts and price gouging 
president bush finally sounded the retreat the day before the commission 
vote he could accept a mechanism that would mitigate any severe price 
spike he insisted that the final results were not firm price controls 
which arguably they are not 
gov gray davis who begged for help for months said the final package 
didnt go far enough what he wanted were tougher limits pegged to generation 
costs plus a profit figure of 30 to 50 percent 
the final formula approved by the commission amounts to a loosefit limit 
that should dampen the absurd price surges that have endangered the state 
the 247 plan rewards modern plants by setting prices based on the 
leastefficient power producers it covers 11 states not just sickly 
california 
there is room for doubt canny operators may find ways to exploit the pricing 
mechanism also california will be whacked with a onestateonly surcharge 
of 10 percent the commission took no action on another davis complaint that 
power generators may have overcharged the state by 62 billion 
still the new limits may be the most anyone could expect consider how far 
washington has come a hidebound ideology has given way to realworld 
recognition of a huge problem us sen dianne feinstein acknowledged as 
much yesterday when she dropped a measure to impose stricter price limits 
californias troubles arent over conservation remains supremely important 
new power plants need approval and speedy construction the financial damage 
to state utilities and the states coffers needs attention the severity of 
summer blackouts is a wild card 
the federal controls add a measure of protection from this volatile mix its 
a shame that help didnt come sooner

feinstein halts electricity price caps bill 
posted at 1215 am pdt wednesday june 20 2001 
by jim puzzanghera 

mercury news 


washington  like a steam valve on an overheating boiler the move by 
federal regulators to enact broad new electricity price controls in the west 
has relieved much of the growing political pressure for stronger action  
for now 
sen dianne feinstein removed one major source of that pressure tuesday 
satisfied that the federal energy regulatory commission has taken a giant 
step forward in curbing california energy prices feinstein withdrew her 
legislation to enact price caps on wholesale electricity prices throughout 
the west 
lets watch and wait and see how this order works the california 
democrat told members of the commission during a senate hearing 
but while the battle over the actions of federal regulators may have 
subsided the larger political war over energy prices continues 
california gov gray davis who has been pounding away for weeks at the bush 
administration for not providing enough help to the state will step into the 
fray here today the governor will appear at a senate hearing where he will 
praise federal regulators for moving in the right direction with the new 
plan but hes also expected to continue to press for harder price caps and 
criticize federal regulators for taking months to act while the state drained 
billions from its budget to pay for electricity 
in addition davis will question some aspects of the plan such as the lack 
of strong action on forcing refunds from suppliers he wants to make sure 
that congress gets the message loud and clear that we want our money back 
from the overcharges by generators said davis media representative steve 
maviglio 
but the republicans are just as eager to lay responsibility for the 
electricity crisis on davis who is up for reelection next year a 
hardhitting republicanbacked tv ad campaign in california organized by 
scott reed a former executive director of the republican national committee 
blames the governor for failing to act quickly when the crisis first emerged 
the politics of shifting blame are likely to set the tone for the hearings 
organized by the new democratic chair of the senate governmental affairs 
committee sen joe lieberman dconn davis and all five ferc commissioners 
have been invited to the hearing to determine if the commission has lived up 
to its legal obligation to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices 
in california 
price controls 
with that oversight hearing pending this week the commission called a 
special meeting monday and took stronger action it expanded existing 
electricity price controls around the clock and to 11 western states under 
the commissions plan ceiling prices will be set that suppliers can exceed 
as long as they provide justification for the higher price a hard price cap 
would set a price that could not be exceeded 
commission chairman curt hbert a republican said politics played no role 
in enacting the new plan but commissioner william massey one of two 
democrats on the fivemember commission acknowledged that political pressure 
in recent weeks from republicans and newly empowered democrats in the senate 
had an impact 
we are an independent agency but we operate in a highly charged political 
environment i would not imply that we did not rule on an independent basis 
here but you know this is washington dc for gods sake massey told 
the mercury news on tuesday i think that it was enlightening to the agency 
that this wasnt just a democratic question this was democrats and 
republicans throughout the west saying my god solve this problem and so 
we hope we have 
the white house which had opposed any form of price controls also moved to 
adjust to this political reality 
to the degree that it is a marketbased program this is in keeping with 
what the president said and the president is pleased to be able to help 
california in that manner white house press secretary ari fleischer said 
it does not change the presidents fundamental view that a separate 
economic matter which would be price controls would not be productive 
but democrats are eager to point to the shift as evidence that the white 
house realized it was paying too high a political price for its earlier 
position insisting that the electricity crisis was largely californias 
problem to solve 
the bush administration is realizing the jig is up the game is over 
said sen barbara boxer dcalif their attitude of handsoff has hurt them 
deeply 
democrats in the house have vowed to continue pushing for a vote on their own 
pricecaps bill the legislation is adamantly opposed by republican leaders 
in congress who believe fercs actions monday are enough government 
intervention 
i hope that its actions are based on market principles not political 
halfmeasures said house majority whip tom delay rtexas its now time 
for governor davis to stop pointing fingers and shifting blame 
feinstein has vowed to quickly resurrect her bill if electricity prices shoot 
up dramatically boxer said she will introduce legislation to force ferc to 
order power suppliers to refund what the state says are billions of dollars 
in overcharges for electricity purchases 
meeting on refunds 
the commission has set up a conference for the state suppliers and utilities 
to settle the contentious refund issue by july 10 if no settlement can be 
reached under the auspices of an administrative law judge the judge will 
make a recommendation to the commission and it will resolve the dispute 
hbert said 
massey had supported feinsteins legislation to force him and his fellow 
commissioners to enact price caps but after the commission unanimously 
approved its expanded pricecontrol plan he joined the four other 
commissioners tuesday in urging the senate energy and natural resources 
committee not to pass such a law 
the commissions chair hbert strongly warned against legislative action 
saying i believe in my heart and i know in my educated mind that we are 
on the right track 
but the issue disappeared tuesday as feinstein and the republican cosponsor 
of the pricecap legislation tabled their plan 
i think it renders substantially moot the legislative efforts that she and 
i were pursuing sen gordon smith rore said of the commissions new 
pricecontrol plan and i do believe that effort would have won large 
majorities in the senate and the house and so i think what you are doing is 
reflecting the will of the elected representatives of the american people 
feinstein said that whatever the commission calls the plan it is close 
enough to hard caps to merit a chance to work 
i view this action by ferc as a giant step forward and im very grateful to 
you she told the commissioners i also view the fact that senator smith 
and i have worked hard on this bill perhaps has been helpful in urging you 
along 













fercs fixes have fallen short 
published wednesday june 20 2001 in the san jose mercury news 
by frank wolak 
on monday for the third time in the past eight months the federal energy 
regulatory commission the agency charged with regulating wholesale 
electricity prices in california implemented remedies that it claims will 
set just and reasonable wholesale electricity prices this is a case where 
the third time is unlikely to be a charm 
as chairman of the market surveillance committee of the california 
independent system operator the independent committee formed by ferc to 
monitor the california market i have analyzed the results of fercs previous 
attempts they reveal a misunderstanding of important details of the 
california electricity market it is therefore not surprising that they have 
been ineffective 
starting in november of 2000 ferc acknowledged that wholesale prices in 
california during the summer of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable its 
december 2000 order implemented the first set of remedies both the 
california power exchange market monitoring committee and the committee i 
chair pointed out important shortcomings in fercs analysis of the california 
market and argued that its remedies would most likely harm rather than 
enhance market performance 
at this time ferc also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonable 
prices even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of 
market power which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher the 
federal power act requires refunds under these circumstances but ferc said 
it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power 
this makes no sense if ferc finds that prices indicate market power then 
the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power 
following the implementation of these remedies conditions in the california 
market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market 
monitoring committees even though january and february are the lowest demand 
months of the year average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 times 
higher in 2001 than they were during the same two months of 2000 and almost 
double the average price during the summer of 2000 in january march and 
may california experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had system 
emergencies almost every day during january and february of 2001 
in april ferc made another round of market rule changes designed to lead to 
just and reasonable prices however in response to growing pressure from 
congress less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented ferc 
enacted its most recent order 
before congress declares victory it should verify that fercs most recent 
plan achieves the following two goals 
first the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale 
electricity paid by california over the next two years is equal to the 
average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market with 
californias current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs the federal 
power act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates 
it requires that they occur with certainty 
the second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants 
so that it will no longer be profitmaximizing for a firm to withhold 
electricity from the market in order to drive up prices 
fercs most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goals 
although it does come closer than any previous attempts 
one solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to ferc in a 
december report to ferc the market surveillance committee of the california 
iso proposed a onetime regulatory intervention this intervention would 
require that each generator serving california sign a forward contract 
guaranteeing that california consumers can purchase 75 percent of the 
generators expected output over the next two years at a specified 
competitive benchmark price once a firm has signed these forward contracts 
it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western us wholesale market 
at whatever price it can obtain 
the obligation to provide power under the contracts and the incentive to 
sell 25 percent of power at unrestricted prices would prevent generators 
from withholding power 
unless ferc implements a solution satisfying these two goals congress should 
require ferc to suspend the marketbased pricing authority for all suppliers 
in the western us for the next two years and order all sales during this 
period at costofservice prices this will guarantee that ferc meets the 
statutory mandate of the federal power act in california

easing the crunch on costs of power 
it could have been worse yesterday the federal energy regulatory commission 
expanded limited price caps on electricity to cover 11 western states and to 
last 24 hours a day during an emergency 
this follows an action in april that imposed caps only in california during 
the hours the state declared a power emergency 
under the new rules when reserves are below 7 percent in the california 
independent system operator spot markets  the maximum price that can be 
charged for spot market sales  will be 85 percent of the highest hourly 
price that was in effect during the most recent stage 1 emergency called by 
the iso the ferc explained yesterday
the order will last until sept 30 2001 
the action came after intense pressure by democrats and the bush 
administration on the ferc whose three republican and two democrat members 
all voted for the new controls
it also comes after continuing stories about gouging by suppliers on 
sunday the register reported how tulsabased williams an energy supplier 
manipulated the market to keep prices high 
and after gov gray davis last week attacked los angeles governmentrun 
department of water and power for gouging the state on electricity purchases 
reported the los angeles daily news the dwp caved in and agreed to start 
selling the state power at cost
the new ferc ruling certainly is better than the demand for acrosstheboard 
continuous price controls demanded by gov davis and other democrats
theyre trying to let the market do the best it can under tremendous 
pressure robert michaels a professor of economics at cal state fullerton 
told us of the ferc members its explicitly only for one kind of power 
that on shortterm socalled spot market kinds of exchanges most power is 
under other kinds of contracts not touched
the main effect of the new order is that unlike fullblown price controls 
it should not discourage the construction of new power generators

b ferc order seen having little effect on us generator profits 






june 20 2001 




by christine cordner
san francisco june 19 bridgenews  a us federal energy regulatory 
commission order to impose a soft price cap on us west wholesale power 
prices will likely have little significant effect on producer profits from 
electricity sales while the order is in effect over the next year industry 
analysts said tuesday some analysts cautioned that some producers without 
longterm contracts could be negatively affected by the order 

                                      


fercs decision to expand the soft price cap throughout the western grid is 
not very painful for generators barry abramson ubs warburg analyst said 
in a research note the expanded soft price cap will have little impact on 
the earnings of the wholesale generating companies by definition every 
other power plant is more efficient than the least efficient power plant and 
thus every other power plant should be able to make a good profit selling at 
the soft price cap 
furthermore on most days most of the power that is produced is sold at 
prices below the soft price cap so the softprice cap has little impact on 
the overall earnings of the wholesale generators in the region abramson 
said 
ferc on monday unanimously voted 5to0 to expand wholesale price caps to the 
10 western states comprising the western systems coordinating council ferc 
also expanded the price caps on wholesale power to 24 hours per day seven 
days per week from limits only during supply emergencies when reserve 
margins in california fall below 7 
under the order wholesale power prices will be limited to 85 of the price 
in effect during the final hour of the most recent emergency when california 
is not in a supply emergency the proxy price will be based on the costs for 
the least efficient power plant used to generate electricity on that day as 
well as the price for natural gas 
generators investorowned utilities and independent power producers 
however can receive more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher 
generation costs the plan also allows a 10 surcharge on all wholesale power 
sales in california in order to account for credit risk 
in a research note jp morgan analysts jim von riesemann and anatol feygin 
said that earnings for generating companies should remain relatively intact 
and valuations look attractive especially for aes mirant and nrg 
robert winters a bear stearns analyst said the nearterm actions by the 
ferc and the focus on mondays meeting the heightened political rhetoric 
and the weakening in gas and power prices across much of the us over the 
past month has led to the weakness in the shares of the wholesale energy 
companieswe believe very attractive buying opportunities are being created 
within certain areas of the wholesale energy sectors where companies are now 
trading at discounts to their projected earnings growth range 
winters said there were buying opportunities with williams which continues 
to be our top pick in the wholesale energy space and with enron corp 
but abramson noted that the order does not allow producers to mark up the r 
price of spot power for resale above the soft price cap which could affect 
some profit margins 
the ferc plan should make it challenging for some to repeat the growth of 
the last couple of quarters in the west particularly those that without 
longterm contracts it appears that the plan would likely dampen volatility 
although price caps can have unexpected consequences said merrill lynch 
analyst steven fleishman 
on a relative basis we believe companies that have locked up much of their 
capacity under longterm contracts and have efficient baseload power are best 
positioned under the new ferc plan fleishman said in a note he said 
calpine dynegy nrg energy and williams stand to benefit the most from this 
scenario 
companies that could be challenged are those with less longterm contracts 
that are more dependent on inefficient peaking plants and that could be 
affected by less volatility in the west fleishman said the big question 
is how well the marketers positioned their books ahead of this changed 
environment he said reliant resources since it appears to have the least 
contracted in the west for 2002 
the plan which will be in effect from wednesday to sept 30 2002 follows 
pleas from california gov gray davis to control wholesale prices which he 
said cost the state roughly 50 billion this year 
the states largest utility pacific gas  electric declared bankruptcy 
earlier this year citing losses from high wholesale prices end 









sce unveils rotating blackout web site and public notification plan 






june 20 2001 




rosemead calif june 19 prnewswire via newsedge corporation  
southern california edison sce today unveiled its enhanced web site and 
public notification process to help guide the public through possible 
rotating power blackouts when ordered by the california independent system 
operator caliso 
we have been able to increase significantly the amount of outage information 
available to our customers because we want to empower them with critical 
information to prepare for and safely cope through power blackouts said pam 
bass sces senior vice president of customer service we recognize that the 
more information customers have before and during rotating outages the 
better equipped they will be to address the concerns and safety of their 
families and employees 
bass said customers have indicated they want to know four basic things when 
rotating blackouts occur the location the duration whether it affects 
them and what they should and should not do to safely get through the 
outages sce offers several information resources that address these concerns 
 through tollfree phone lines through news media updates and now through 
an expanded userfriendly rotating outage web site 
all of these sources will tell customers that the outages rotate among 
electrical circuits across sces vast service area for about one hour as 
directed by caliso they will also list the likely affected customer groups 
and communities and even provide geographic maps outlining the specific 
neighborhoods customers will also be able to access practical tips on how to 
prepare and function safely through outages 
customers can find out the group their home or business is assigned to by 
identifying their alphanumeric rotating outage group number which now 
appears directly under the customers name and address in the top left corner 
of the bills front page when caliso predicts possible rotating outages 
sce will immediately announce which groups may be affected through its outage 
hotline  800 6111911  its web site    and through the 
news media 
when outages are forecasted or actually begin customers can determine if 
their group is part of the current outage or likely to be included in the 
next round since sce generally interrupts groups in numerical order with 
some exceptions for example customers can now hear on the morning news 
whether caliso is predicting outages for the day by calling the hotline or 
checking  they can learn which groups would likely be interrupted 
if circumstances turn out as predicted if their group number is on the list 
of groups likely to be interrupted the customer could take steps to prepare 
for the likelihood of rotating blackouts affecting their home or business 
that particular day 
it should be noted that group numbers may change without advance notice for 
operational reasons or when state regulators revise their policy regarding 
customers exempted from blackouts sce will notify customers of such changes 
as quickly as practical 
visitors to sces customer web site  will find the following 
helpful enhancements 
 the site displays outage group numbers and corresponding communities 
affected during recent current and predicted rotating outage 
incidents 
 when customers click on the name of a community affected by an outage 
they are taken to a detailed street map of the affected circuit 
 the web site offers general outage information and links including 
outage preparation and safety tips grid status information from cal 
iso frequently asked questions about rotating outages and 
conservation tips 
 a dynamic homepage popup window will change messages depending on 
state power conditions for example during a stage 2 emergency 
customers will be directed to information about potential outages 
during a stage 3 emergency in which rotating outages are underway the 
box will provide a hotlink to group numbers and communities currently 
affected and likely to be affected should outages likely continue 
for customers who dont have internet access sce provides essentially the 
same web site information through an automated outage phone line 800 
6111911 this service makes it possible to obtain outage information 
immediately without waiting among major features 
 customers can call at any time to learn the rotating outage group 
number assigned to their home or business 
 when customers experience a power blackout they can call to determine 
whether they are part of a rotating outage incident or if their 
circuit has been affected by a routine interruption such as a car or 
construction accident 
 during rotating blackouts customers can learn if their circuit is 
currently affected or may be affected in the coming hours and which 
portions of specific communities may be affected 
 when customers call they should have their account number and group 
number handy however if customers call during a rotating outage 
incident and do not know their group number they will be able to 
obtain information by entering their zip code 
sces media relations office has developed strategic communications 
partnerships with radio and television stations that provide frequent live 
updates to the public including information about circuit groups affected or 
likely to be affected by outages 
it should be further noted that while sce is committed to providing as much 
advance public notification about pending rotating blackouts it can only do 
so as it receives timely notification from caliso

edison ceo ruling hasnt helped 






june 20 2001 





by leslie gornstein
ap business writer
los angeles ap via newsedge corporation  
a federal ruling this week limiting wholesale energy prices in 10 western 
states hasnt been enough to pull southern california edison any further from 
the brink of bankruptcy edison international chief john e bryson said 
tuesday 
the states secondlargest utility is no further from or closer to bankruptcy 
now than it was two weeks four weeks six weeks ago bryson told a press 
conference before a speech to town hall los angeles a public policy forum 
bryson is chairman president and chief executive officer of edison 
international parent of subsidiary southern california edison which serves 
42 million customers 
bryson said however that he senses a warming among state legislators to a 
proposed bailout deal between his company and the state 
that deal would supply billions of dollars to edison in exchange for years of 
cheap power and possibly the utilitys power lines 
interest has at least intensified in sacramento on the part of legislators 
to take steps  debate continues exactly what steps  to have edison healthy 
and to take the state out of the power business and so on bryson said 
such lawmaker approval is required for the deal to survive key lawmakers 
surrounding the deal were not immediately available for comment 
in his town hall address bryson used the forum as a kind of open plea to 
state legislators listing what he called a series of widespread myths that 
might be keeping leaders from acting 
the first myth is that somehow southern california edison is seeking a 
bailout from taxpayers bryson said only the reverse is true 
instead bryson said it was edison who bailed out california by keeping the 
lights on even when the utilitys power costs far exceeded its revenues 
secondly bryson said edison and its investors are not profiting from the 
power crisis and socal edisons parent did not act improperly by collecting 
money from the utility earlier this year 
that money was later given to shareholders a move that outraged consumer 
groups 
bryson also warned that a socal edison bankruptcy would severely hurt 
californias economy by scaring away new businesses and investment capital 
inaction would deeply hurt the state of california and all of us he 
said 










editorial desk section a 
at last action on california 
 
06202001 
the new york times 
page 22 column 1 
c 2001 new york times company 
after months of dithering the federal energy regulatory commission took some 
potentially meaningful steps on monday to contain the wholesale price of 
electricity in california and elsewhere in the western united states anxious 
not to be seen as caving in to public pressure or abandoning its fidelity to 
the free market the white house described the new policy as consistent 
with where the president has been all along gov gray davis of california 
 for his part said the policy did not go far enough and of course only 
time will tell whether it does but to many others including senator dianne 
feinstein of california  the move amounted to the first significant federal 
intervention in the california wholesale market since the crisis began last 
year ms feinstein withdrew her own pricecap bill pending the outcome of 
the new plan 
under the new arrangement approved unanimously by a reshuffled fivemember 
regulatory commission price limits will be based on the cost of producing 
electricity at the least efficient generator the formula covers the sale of 
electricity for immediate delivery  the socalled spot market that 
supplies about 20 percent of california s needs and that california turns to 
when it is desperately trying to keep the lights on the companies will be 
allowed to charge higher prices during peak periods but not the huge sums 
they command today 
in addition the constraints will apply throughout 10 other western states 
presumably eliminating any incentive for generators to withhold power from 
the california market in order to obtain a higher price elsewhere the 
controls are to expire in september of next year which should relieve some 
of the administrations earlier fears that constraints of any kind would 
discourage investment in new and badly needed sources of supply 
the benefits will not immediately be felt by california consumers both 
individuals and businesses have recently been hit by rate increases belatedly 
imposed by the states public utilities commission at mr daviss request 
but the new plan should ultimately benefit taxpayers by lessening the impact 
of higher energy costs on the state government which has been buying power 
on behalf of the states two largest utilities both essentially insolvent 
recent estimates have suggested that california  which paid 7 billion for 
electricity two years ago could pay as much as 50 billion this year 
until quite recently the president and his energy czar dick cheney had 
seemed almost indifferent to california s needs but republican members of 
congress from california and other western states have been growing 
increasingly restive as they contemplate the potential political fallout in 
the midterm elections of 2002 in addition the two newest members of the 
regulatory commission both bush appointees have expressed sympathy for 
california s plight whatever the reason the administration appears to have 
seen the light even though it is reluctant to admit it

regulators order could bring broad california power accord

the new york times 
page 14 column 3 
c 2001 new york times company 
los angeles june 19  an order by federal regulators that power generators 
enter settlement talks with the state of california could open the door to a 
sweeping compromise of the financial issues in the states power crisis 
energy industry analysts and executives said today 
but the question that remains  and it is a vital one they said  is 
whether the federal energy regulatory commission has the wherewithal to force 
the warring parties to hammer out an understanding that at its heart is as 
much about politics as about money 
the commission on monday gave california regulators and power generators 
until july 9 to come up with a plan for settling accounts between the 
generators and california s struggling utilities the power companies are 
owed billions but the state has accused them of pricegouging if the 
parties cannot reach some agreement an administrative judge will step in and 
recommend a settlement to the commission instead 
asked at a senate hearing in washington today to clarify what he hoped to 
accomplish as a result of the two weeks of settlement talks the commissions 
chairman curtis l hebert jr was noncommittal the parties he explained 
need two things for the talks to succeed a deadline and uncertainty 
senator dianne feinstein democrat of california  expressed skepticism about 
the undertaking ms feinstein said at the hearing held by the senate energy 
and natural resources committee that she was concerned that the commission 
had laid out no rules for the talks 
very little if any money has changed hands as a result of prior 
settlement conferences she said 
many industry executives and state officials have not yet seen the 
commissions order and they were scrambling today to figure out exactly what 
they were being asked to do 
without seeing what exactly is in the order who knows said sean 
gallagher a staff lawyer for california s public utilities commission 
but we wouldnt turn our noses up at participating in negotiations 
gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum a 
coalition of energy traders and electricity generators noted that the 
federal regulators timetable has a very short fuse and the fact that 
the states biggest utility the pacific gas and electric company has filed 
for bankruptcy will complicate efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement he 
added 
i dont hold high hopes that a settlement would work out mr ackerman 
said but i commend the ferc for taking a stab 
moreover the parties to the settlement talks may lack an element vital to 
successful negotiations trust 
several california entities including the public utilities commission are 
investigating whether generators took advantage of consumers by charging 
excessive prices for power the independent system operator which runs the 
states power grid released a study in march concluding that californians 
might have been overcharged for electricity by more than 6 billion one 
state government negotiator said the california attorney generals office 
could file a suit against the power generators in the next few weeks 
and as state officials including gov gray davis continue to hurl attacks 
at the generators calling them pirates and profiteers the companies and 
california utilities are blaming legislators saying they failed to address 
the power crisis quickly enough 
in march duke energy one of the companies the state has accused of 
profiteering offered to negotiate a broad settlement but governor davis 
ruled out calling off the states inquiries as part of any agreement 
the outlines of dukes proposal included a compromise on the money owed by 
california utilities in exchange for the dropping of private lawsuits 
california s complaints to federal regulators and the state investigations 
duke would have admitted no wrongdoing 
in formal proceedings the power generators to date have vigorously fought 
discounting the debts they are owed by california  
the federal energy regulatory commission has ordered generators to refund 
nearly 130 million in what it judged to be overcharges today one of the 
commissioners william l massey said 80 percent of that money had not been 
collected

los angeles june 19  sinking in the polls under attack by a new 
republican advertising campaign and still struggling to avert a summer of 
blackouts california gov gray davis d nevertheless seems heartened about 
the latest developments in the power crisis that has engulfed his state and 
threatened his political career 
on his first trip to washington in months davis will detail california s 
plight wednesday in testimony to a senate committee newly led by sympathetic 
democrats  one important reason for his optimism 
but he has others conservation is taking hold in the state and prices for 
power on the daily spot market are dropping california has managed to avoid 
rolling blackouts so far this month in part because it has been spared a 
heat wave 
federal regulators under pressure even from republican lawmakers decided 
monday to impose more controls on prices that energy suppliers can charge 
california  two new power plants are scheduled to begin producing 
electricity in weeks california also has recently secured more than a dozen 
deals for power over the next decade a move davis contends will stabilize 
the volatile wholesale market for energy 
in short davis and his aides say their concerted political strategy and 
efforts to ease the crisis are beginning to pay off 
the bottom line is that were stabilizing prices and assuring the power will 
be there without additional rate increases said steve maviglio a spokesman 
for the governor but he added were not ready to say the war is over its 
still going to be a tight summer 
whether any or all of those steps will keep the lights on in california this 
summer or help solve an array of other financial problems the crisis has 
caused is hardly clear 
in fact california s power shortfall could produce 113 hours of rotating 
outages this summer according to a us department of energy study scheduled 
to be released wednesday 
since california s two largest utilities fell into financial ruin this year 
forcing the state to spend nearly 5 billion to buy power directly and 
saddling residents with huge new rate increases the support that davis once 
had from a majority of voters has vanished recent polls suggest that he 
could have trouble winning a second term 
consumer advocates here are besieging him saying that the 43 billion in 
longterm power deals that davis has signed could lock residents into paying 
artificially high utility rates for years some contend that all he has 
gained from washington is political cover 
the bush administration has created this toothless price cap mechanism that 
will be used as political protection but certainly not consumer protection 
said doug heller a director of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer 
rights 
davis has stuck mostly to the same political script he is demanding more 
federal help for california  on monday he called the federal energy 
regulatory commissions decision merely a step in the right direction  
and he is denouncing outofstate energy suppliers and their republican 
allies 
today republicans launched a 15 million advertising offensive that blames 
davis for the states energy crunch the spots running on english and 
spanishlanguage media describe the crisis as grayouts from gray davis 
scott reed the gop strategist who runs the american taxpayers alliance 
which funded the ad campaign said his group wants to counter the governors 
spin the blame game has to end said reed 
but daviss aides say the ads are a sign that republicans sense california s 
energy predicament could deepen gop political troubles in the state 
privately some republican lawmakers pushing for more federal assistance say 
they are worried that in midterm congressional elections next fall the gop 
could lose house seats in california that it needs to hold a majority 
todays hearing will bring both davis and his adversaries on the federal 
energy regulatory commission before the senates governmental affairs 
committee chaired by sen joseph i lieberman dconn 
instead of a committee debate on california s electricity prices the focus 
of the session may be shifting toward the billions of dollars of alleged 
overcharges by energy suppliers 
under growing pressure from both parties in congress fercs commissioners 
responded monday with far more extensive price controls than they had been 
willing to consider previously they extended april price controls that had 
applied only to times of power emergencies to all hours of the day through 
september 2002 and they expanded the controls to cover 10 other western 
states 
california sens dianne feinstein and barbara boxer both democrats said 
fercs action was a positive step and agreed to delay efforts to direct the 
commission to clamp down on california s energy prices were willing to 
give them a chance to see if it works boxer told reporters 
now davis will press his demands that ferc recover some 8 billion in 
alleged overcharges by wholesale power suppliers since the crisis began  a 
far larger amount than the 1245 million in refunds that ferc has so far 
assessed 
whether there is even a chance of a peace process is unclear just last week 
california attorney general bill lockyer announced plans to convene a 
criminal grand jury to investigate whether power generators illegally 
conspired to drive up electricity and natural gas prices 
the governor could face other new problems several of california s major 
independent power generators said the price controls and state lawsuits 
against the generators made it more difficult to justify expanding operations 
in california  a warning echoed today by energy secretary spencer abraham 
but heading into the summer california s power prices are much lower than 
they were a month or two ago with daily or spot power prices averaging 78 
per megawatt hour in june compared to 372 in april 
both davis and the ferc commissioners are taking credit s david freeman 
daviss energy adviser said that the longterm power contracts the state has 
signed the new power plants and favorable weather have tamed prices 
ferc chairman curt hebert jr said monday that the limited price restraints 
that the commission imposed on wholesale electricity sales in april have been 
a key reason for the price decline

national desk section a 
the lesson of when to give aid to free markets
by david e sanger
 
06202001 
the new york times 
page 14 column 3 
c 2001 new york times company 
washington june 19  three weeks ago george w bush addressed a sympathetic 
audience of business executives at the century plaza hotel in los angeles and 
declared that his administration will not take any action that makes 
california s problems worse and thats why i oppose price caps on 
electricity  
as he spoke the democratic governor of california  gray davis sat 
impassively on the dais preparing to meet mr bush and then denounce him for 
failing to protect california consumers from an electricity market gone wild 
today the white house halfheartedly welcomed action by federal regulators to 
impose throughout the west a system that looks and smells a lot like price 
caps  though the white house said it was something different 
this is not a price control ari fleischer the white house spokesman 
said this is a marketbased mitigation plan that now will extend to 11 
western states 
in fact it bore some resemblance to a proposal made by 10 leading economists 
who urged a middle ground between fixed prices and a deregulated electricity 
market mr davis used their proposal to support his position in favor of 
limited price restraints when mr bush visited california  
the white house shift from outright opposition to price controls to its more 
nuanced position today exemplifies how mr bush has tempered his embrace of 
completely unfettered markets in recent weeks he didnt have much choice 
as the threat of blackouts loomed demands for action rose from officials of 
both parties and from consumers in the west it was almost possible to hear 
sighs of relief at the white house today that the federal energy regulatory 
commission  an independent body in the energy department  had moved to 
turn down the political heat 
in fact while some house democrats are still pressing for firmer caps on 
prices senators dianne feinstein democrat of california  and gordon h 
smith republican of oregon withdrew a bill that would have placed strict 
price controls on electricity sold in western markets 
senator feinstein said the white house could call yesterdays regulatory 
action mitigation or anything else it pleased 
a rose is a rose by any other name she said today 
and a free market is not always free two weeks ago the administration said 
it would rescue steel companies and steelworkers who have long complained 
about unfair competition from south korea taiwan china brazil germany 
russia and ukraine the white house defended the action by saying it was the 
only way for the industry to adjust to a new competitive environment 
last month with no major announcements at the white house the bush 
administration voted for international monetary fund aid to two countries 
turkey and argentina that like california  had made some economically 
disastrous political decisions 
in each case mr bushs economic orthodoxies were tempered by political 
realities 
the california crisis was one thing when it involved a democratic governor in 
a state mr bush lost by a million votes it was another one of his aides 
conceded today when congressional republicans from around the west were 
warning mr bush that blackouts and skyhigh prices could blow up in his 
first year in office 
we heard from a lot of members of congress who feared that republicans 
would be tarred with worsening the problem even though it happened on gray 
daviss watch the political aide said the president took that on 
board 
similarly the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against 
dumping foreign products in the market  and partly about mr bushs 
desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda like 
californians coping with higher energy prices the steelworkers need time to 
adjust to a new world the administration said 
open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity choice 
and economic freedom robert b zoellick mr bushs trade representative 
said in an interview today but compassionate conservatism also recognizes 
the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communities 
and industries which he said need vital breathing space to adapt to 
change 
while mr bush expressed deep reservations about imf bailouts during the 
presidential campaign the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he 
got to washington the state and defense departments feared that if turkey 
were engulfed in economic chaos and blamed the united states for failing to 
come to its aid its leaders might be less inclined to let american fighter 
jets use its territory to mount missions over iraq 
so given the choice between letting the turkish people pay a high price for 
political mistakes  californians take note  and weakening american 
pressure on saddam hussein mr bush decided that economic niceties were less 
important than political consistency mr bush chose the pentagon over the 
treasury 
administration officials said these actions did not represent a retreat from 
letthemarketsprevail orthodoxy 
lawrence b lindsey mr bushs chief economic adviser said in an interview 
today that he opposed price caps at the beginning of the california crisis 
and that he opposed them now but he would not criticize the federal 
commission for mitigating price spikes in the market 
what they are trying to do is achieve two incompatible missions  
preserving what is called just and reasonable pricing and assuring an 
adaquate supply of electricity  mr lindsey said yet the reality he 
added is that new supplies of electricity will not become available for a 
year or more ferc is doing its best to square that circle in the face of 
the fundamental problem which is inadequate supply he said 
that is the kind of argument that keeps economists happily arguing for hours 
it is not likely to be the kind of argument mr bush himself is likely to 
engage in for long as one of his political advisers said the other day

more electricity  but we also need to produce some more seats in the

i  had  the  misfortune  recently  of listening to your presentation at the 
aipn
conference in cape town south africa i had to leave immediately following 
your
talk  otherwise i would have challenged you about the contents of you talk 
you
used  this  opportunity  to  criticise  bankers  lenders  as  you  called 
them
referring  to  them  as  quote concrete shoes and also criticised 
parastatals
commenting that they never offer to buy you lunch such idiotic references 
are
not  what  i would expect from an officer of enron corporation although your 
cv
indicates  that infact you are part of merrill international it is not clear 
if
you are also an officer of enron

i  as  a  director of hsbc investment bank  plus my uk and rsa based 
colleagues
have over recent years spent a considerable amount of time and money  
performing
various  studies  for  enron  iro  the proposed misp and gas export project 
plus
project sunshine etc  hsbc have not billed enron for any of this work

i  had the pleasure of meeting  dr ken lay at cera in february and amongst 
other
things  he  referred  to  the  various  problems  enron had experienced wrt 
this
project  and  stated  that quote  enron do not build steel plants  this 
clear
and  honest  comment  from  your  boss  is  welcome  and  this is indeed 
enrons
prerogative  what  i  object  to  frankly  is a presentation that maintains 
the
pretence  of a project and seeks to blame third parties such as lenders and 
para
statal organisations for difficulties you may have experienced

i suggest that it is in everyones interest to speak openely and 
constructively
i  for one have no problem at all enron saying that their future is in 
broadband
and not in steel plants in mozambique

if  anyone  is  interested in my own views as to how things could have been 
done
differently out here i would be delighted to let you  or dr lay know

c reuters limited 2000

washington nov 1 reuters  the federal energy regulatory commission on 
wednesday said in a report that california utilities were not necessarily to 
blame for last summers price rises which led to an unravelling of the 
states move to deregulate retail power markets 
a ferc staff investigation which was to be released in full later on 
wednesday found californias market structure and rules flawed which 
combined with tight supplies caused the price of electricity to rise to 
record highs in both wholesale and retail markets
ferc has proposed rule changes to fix the operations of the california 
independent system operator iso and power exchange px the draft changes 
would eliminate the need for pacific gas and electric san diego gas and 
electric and socal edison from having to sell into or buy from the power 
exchange 
other highlights from the proposal include establihshing an independent 
nonstakeholder to oversee the iso and px modifying the auction market new 
reporting requirements and accelerating new siting of power generation 
facilities and eliminating some environmental impediments to new plants 
if approved by the full commission at its wednesday meeting the changes 
would become effective in 60 days california regulators and industry 
officials have until nov 22 to comment on fercs proposed changes

washington dow jones the us federal energy regulatory commission 
wednesday proposed sweeping structural changes for californias 
problemplague power market 
the commission proposed the changes in response to a staff investigation 
report unveiled wednesday which found no smoking gun evidence that power 
sellers in the state had manipulated market prices to financial benefit
instead ferc blamed the states mandated market structure for the 
electricity supply shortages and spiking wholesale power prices passed on to 
retail customers in san diego 
at the same time utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of 
millions of dollars due to a statemandated rate freeze that required them to 
sell power at below cost

the fate of californias rocky experiment in electricity deregulation hangs 
in the balance today as federal regulators meet to decide whether to 
intercede in the states dysfunctional 23billion energy market or to let 
freemarket forces continue to wreak havoc 
the fourmember federal energy regulatory commission will release a 
longawaited staff report analyzing the root causes of californias energy 
crisis and more important issue a draft order or action plan on how to 
solve the problems of runaway wholesale electricity costs
during public hearings in san diego in september ferc chairman james j 
hoecker promised that the commission would take action and do whatever it 
takes to repair californias electricity market whose deregulation was set 
in motion by landmark state legislation in september 1996 
just what the report and order will say remained a matter of intense 
speculation on the eve of their release the ferc commissioners could impose 
new price caps or order an overhaul of the california power exchange and the 
independent system operator the state agencies that conduct daily auctions 
for electricity the commissioners may ask the state to undertake new 
initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still 
dominated by the three big investorowned utilities 
but an indictment of power generation companieswhich some in the state 
accuse of gaming or manipulating the system to wield unfair market power 
and wringing excessive profits from customersis unlikely according to 
published reports and state industry principals and government officials 
the ferc commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in 
california for a supplydemand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity 
prices skyrocketing in july to an average of 129 cents a kilowatthour more 
than triple the july 1999 average of 39 cents a typical residential 
customer of san diego gas  electric the first state utility to fully 
deregulate saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in 
to cap retail rates in august 
just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates 
remain skyhigh today even after the end of peak summer power demand 
wholesale rates in october averaged about 10 cents a kilowatthour double 
the average cost a year ago said patrick dorinson a spokesman for the 
independent system operator 
in any case billions of dollars of investments as well as the political 
careers of prominent california politicians could be affected by what ferc 
does us energy secretary bill richardson is coming out from washington to 
hold a news conference with gov gray davis in sacramento this morning to 
announce new unspecified initiatives to address californias electricity 
problems 
the davis administration has gone on record demanding that ferc which 
oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the 
country to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore just and fair 
electricity rates in california the ballooning of electricity rates in san 
diego during the summer created a political firestorm that raged unabated 
until the state legislature imposed its caps 
rates paid by retail customers in the southern california edison and pacific 
gas  electric coverage areas are frozen as well for the time being but 5 
billion in undercollectionsthe difference between what the investorowned 
utilities have paid for wholesale electricity this year and what they can 
charge consumerslooms overhead worrying wall street 
i have no idea what the ferc will say said state public utilities 
commission president loretta lynch a davis appointee who says she is as much 
in suspense as anyone but we are expecting a substantial order that would 
move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in california 
consumer advocates and the states major utilities would like to see ferc 
impose some sort of wholesale price controlseven gut the power exchange and 
the independent system operator because they are clearly not working as 
intended 
we expect some radical surgery said doug kline spokesman for sempra 
energy the parent of san diego gas  electric 
some consumer groups would like to see ferc declare the wholesale rates 
collected by generators unjust and unreasonable legal code words that 
would open the gates to actions by the puc or the legislature to force the 
power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit such an action which 
would lead to litigation by the power companies is considered unlikely 
business interests including the power generators that have reaped enormous 
profit from the dysfunctional market are arguing to let freemarket forces 
prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the markets evolution and 
possibly stifle construction of new power plants which offer the best 
longterm solution to the states predicament 
we expect that the ferc will find that the high prices of this past summer 
are a result of supplyanddemand imbalance and market design defects on the 
retail and wholesale side but that the market participants have been playing 
within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming said 
brent bailey general counsel of duke energy north america of houston a 
major generation player in the california market 
duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the states 
municipal utilities notably the los angeles department of water and power 
that the industry in essence be reregulated by imposing a system of 
costbased rate controls similar to how electricity rates were set before 
deregulation 
such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by duke and other power merchants 
alleging confiscatory actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds 
of millions of dollars they have invested in california power plants bailey 
favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance as well as 
new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition 
los angeles dwp general manager s david freeman who has led calls for 
temporary imposition of costbased rates said californias failed 
deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is 
intrinsically an underegulatable service 
three years ago i thought it would work then we had a train wreck he 
said im not committing heresy when i say that i think it may not work out

below are articles that state that deregulation is better for everyone in the 
long run and though the california issue is bad currently it is not because 
of deregulation but because of transmission and generation issues 


a deregulated world is the right market for electricity said ron walter 
senior vice president at calpine an independent power producer in san jose 
that is building three plants 

new york times article


the root cause of californias electricity crisis is regulation not 
deregulation 




other states are learning from ca deregulation and believe that there 
deregulation will be more successful electric utility deregulation is 
sending up sparks in california but thats not shortcircuiting other 
states plans
at least for now many are pledging to learn from californias mistakes and 
forge ahead by opening their own markets
texas ohio and michigan are among 25 that have passed deregulation laws but 
not yet put them into effect the three heavy industrial electricity users 
have big plans for competition






enron is mentioned in this article along with boeing stating thatweve 
certainly been exposed to the higher prices and its uncomfortable in the 
short term said keith warner the energy manager at boeing which spends 
about 200 million on power in the us annually but in the long term 
deregulation and open access to transmission from other electric companies 
is where we want to be in every deregulation weve gone through in this 
country competition has lowered prices
 




this shows a more even view of deregulation stating its faults and its 
advantages the lack of supply has to do with deregulation and the 
uncertainty of a financial return on new investment of generation 
borenstein said but we still would have a supply problem under regulation 
and prices would still be high 






mercury news article states it is not time to reregulate the markets and 
provides the following solutions to solve the crisis article below
matters will improve when california has 
 more sources of power 
 a more sophisticated electricity market 
 smarter consumers  that is consumers with the information they need to 
be thrifty 
also the article talks of the power exchange px and the independent system 
operators iso and how these two groups are making the prices higher ie 
market imperfections that result from the uniqueness of electricity as a 
commodity and the immaturity of the new exchanges are enabling producers to 
obtain higher prices than the underlying conditions dictate 
article concludes by saying the deregulated market is just beginning and with 
a few adjustments will work out fine",articles for ferc,deregulation is better for everyone

"generate subject: as many of you know i am going to be leaving enron to pursue new 
opportunities  
  i am leaving with regret  as i have enjoyed working with all of you and i 
believe ebs
  is poised for great success in asia   to assist in a smooth transition  i 
have prepared 
  this report on  the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions 
i am working on 
  and my thoughts about next steps    a list of key contacts is also 
provided    mark 
  schroeder will reassign pending actions   

   again many many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what i 
have 
   learned about broadband and ebs from each of you 

1   singapore

 a  sbo license application   

        the application was completed in draft in december   dan arzola of 
ebs asia 
        has a copy in houston   we cannot proceed further on the application 
until we 
        decide what  legal entity to use   we have a legal entity enron 
broadband 
        services pte ltd set up that encompasses all ebs activities 
including bandwidth t
        trading   

        the legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a 1 
annual gross
        turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds 
that the 
        turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading 
revenue   this 
        is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator ida does not 
want to be working at cross
        purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide ebs 
with incentives  
        see below
     
    b  legal due diligence
   
        however before pursuing a waiver from ida  we were planning to 
complete legal due 
        diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a 
waiver   
        donald is of the view see his jan 9 email  that bandwidth trading 
has to be
        licensed by the regulator   in europe bandwidth trading usually 
does not 
        require telecom licensing   if donald is correct as he probably is 
there may be 
        less need of further legal research  on that point unless perhaps to 
confirm absolutely 
        that there is no way to shield ebs bandwidth trading from the 
turnover fee apart from
        a waiver or reduction of the fee    for example it is possible  that 
jan haizmann 
        or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee 
done offshore 
        for example   jan i believe has some ideas on this that he adanced 
in the context
        of korea  

        i believe it would still be prudent  to proceed as we had planned to 
engage
        a law firm here in singapore as we have in hong kong and japan for 
the purpose 
        of guiding us through these sorts of questions or at least 
confirming our reading
        and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by 
a working 
        group headed by wayne gardner   we will likely be needing the firm 
anyway at 
        some point  
        
        i have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms 
practice in singapore
        ebs general counsel is planning to examine its asia strategy and whom 
to send and
        when to engage a firm to complete waynes questionnaire and for other 
purposes

         my advice is after the due diligence is completed or we have at 
least confirmed
         that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity  
probably to go to the ida and 
         discuss the implications of the fee for us   the contacts i would 
suggest discussing this
         with are andy haire and fiona yeo see contact list      ida does 
not wish to prevent 
         ebss coming to singapore and the fee was of course set up without 
bandwidth trading
         specifically in mind as a revenue source   bandwidth trading was 
referenced in the
         code only later as a result of enrons comment letters

  c  arthur d little consultant proposal to support ebs pioneer status 
application

         this 75k proposal is now with us in final form after undergoing 
changes by me
         and two by our houston tax lawyers   i was to have gone to adl 
singapore next
         for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to 
         do independently without reliance on us   this was a suggestion 
made by
         jim ginty of ebs tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our 
info    
         i also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would 
be quantified
         rather than a where appropriate     assuming we proceed with this 
proposal 
         someone else will need to do this conversation with adl singapore   

         i have forwarded the final proposal to wayne garder and mark and 
most other
         interested parties earlier this week

        nb   someone needs to be appointed to contact simon maccormac at adl 
and explain
        at least our timing and process for getting back to him as a 
courtesy   i have not 
        replied to his final submission as of now   see contact info at end 
of email

         for background  the reason i believe ebs needs this work and sought 
a consultant
         proposal is that pioneer status is typically awarded  to companies 
that make major
         dollar infrastructure and jobcreation expenditures in 
singapore   our business
         model does just the opposite   so to be awarded pioneer status 
which the edb is
         very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion  i 
believe we need to  
         help edb demonstrate what the quantitative spinoff benefits are for 
singapore from our
         developing bandwidth trading here eg increased efficiencies of 
capacity utilization
         effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment   this 
is a job for a  development 
         economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading   
to my mind
         if adl cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want it 
might be worth it 
         to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with  them and adjust 
the contract
         accordingly to reflect what part we are providing         

         one thing the adl scope of work does not provide for is the actual 
completion of
         the pioneer status application  only the supporting economic 
analysis  that is because it is
         proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for 
singapore rather than
         running that information through adl and charging its overhead  the 
idea is to get
         adl to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we 
cannot do inhouse  

    d   direct contact with edb on ebss plans

         edb chelsia lim  has this week asked ebs to update her on its 
business
         plans for singapore    i have made sure craig clark will take the 
responsibility
         for seeing this is handled   while a courtesy call is fine i would 
advise 
         not to brief her formally until ebs has really decided what our 
plans are
         with staffing etc   they have been asking for our plans for a 
while and
         are waiting for some specifics when we have them


2    hong kong

        we have  2 licenses   ivans value added services and ets external
        telecoms services includes bandwidth trading

        there are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be 
filed
        under these licenses before we are able to operate in hong kong  
        the principal ones are a  the system configuration plan   b the 
tariff for
        sale and trading of circuits under the ets license c the tariff for 
mediacast 
        services under the ivans license and later d a tariff for 
vodeod to
        be filed under the ivans license

        a  status of system configuration plan

        the plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be
         communicated by roger estrada within the next week or two as to 
whether 
         the lucent 10g equipment described in the plan will be changed to 
other 
         equipment    the hk lawyers  michelle chan of clifford chance  
have said 
         that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset we ought 
to just
         wait and send in the correct description rather than revise   if we 
do stick with
         the lucent equipment  we will also need to revise our orginal 
license 
         application as well says michelle chan  to include description of 
related
         cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license 
application

         when the system configuration plan is done in final we also need to 
         change the listed destination in the diagram from san jose  to 
west coast
         usa  japan singapore and australia

         there are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the 
ofta forms 
          i have given one to craig clark of ebs to carry back to houston  
the other
         copy is with annie ng in our singapore office

         when we know what equipment we are going to be using tom wei needs 
to
         revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred 
to above
         other small edits need to be made in appendix a see dec 28 email 
referenced
         below   my successor should review the whole package once more 
with michelle
         chan in final    then the final package needs to be cleared by 
anthony duenner
         and our ebs lawyers before going to ken rice or another qualified 
director of
         our hong kong company for signature   after that it goes back to 
michelle chan
         for filing with ofta

         nb   see michelle chans email of dec 28 being repeated 
separately for 
                  further information  

       b   tariffs for bwtrading under ets license 

        in december in houston i worked with bill white and his staff on a 
tariff plan for
        bandwidth trading in hk   based on a meeting i had with the 
regulator in hong 
        kong   we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an 
entirely new
        and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do   
ceiling  prices 
        were developed and submitted to michelle chan for review   

        along with the prices we are required to submit our terms and 
conditions   for 
        that i used ebs general terms and conditions gtcs for trading 
obtained from 
        robbi rossi and michelle heard  mike grimes  has a set as well   

        present status  right now a dialogue is under way between michelle 
chan and  
        robbi rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the gtcs alone or 
whether 
        certain exhibits service level agreements and confirmations 
referred to in
        the gtcs must also be filed   there are other questions being 
discussed in
        that channel  such as how to handle variations in the terms based on
        commercial dynamics     all these emails will be  forwarded   once 
these
        issues related to the gtcs are resolved the tariff for bandwidth 
trading should
        be filed going through michelle chan

        nb  see michelle chan email of 10901 which being forwarded 
separately


     c  tariff for media cast under ivans license

       i worked with leroy ho and ken wang in december and we submitted the 
main
       part of the media cast tariff to michelle chan   however we still 
need to get the
       terms and conditions for media cast from robbi rossi or michelle heard 
and
       attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to michelle chan 
       
       nb   see my email to michelle chan of dec 21 which being repeated
       someone needs to work with ebs legal to get the t and cs for media 
cast to michelle
       or to set up direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in
       the case of the exchanges on the t and cs for bandwidth trading 
referred
       to above

      d   overall change of responsibility for ebs regulatory hk

3    korea

       robbi rossi needs to call kim and chang law firm we use in korea
       to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to 
handle 
       the apparent regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in korea that
       we identified during my november trip

       once kim and chang starts work on this someone from regulatory should
       be made available to help guide kim and chang on our regulatory 
       questions in coordination with robbi rossi

       the key emails are a one from me outlining the overall problem and
        some suggestions for dealing with it   b one from jan haizmann 
with 
        some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how
        to deal with it  c  two from jae moo lee in korea with additional
        points of view  these will be forwarded  


  4   japan  

       our regulatory consultant is art yanagawa   contact info below  mike 
grimes 
       and i have been in meetings with him and  mike is fully briefed to 
carry on the 
       ontheground  part of contacts with art   art also responds to 
donald and 
       roger estrada and relies on them for guidance and input     

      at some point it should be thought through who should be the point 
person
      to manage  this contract and approve payments or decide to leave things
      as they are with approvals done in houston    the present system works 
but
      it is not clear to me who is responsible for what  

      art has prepared the amendment to our special type 2  license to add
      service to other destinations   the latest status was that he was 
holding
      the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by
      mike grimes    someone needs to be assigned responsibility for
      getting the amendment through  

      general concern      

      a more general regulatory concern for us in japan is that our 
consultant 
      advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading  in 
      communications with the government because it is not something 
      contemplated in the telecom business law  so is prohibited if 
      stated as we would state it elsewhere   

      we therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make 
      what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something
      else    i admit that i agree with the approach we are taking for now 
and 
      can offer nothing better for the immediate term    

      however i would say that long term we are running some risks    if we 
      are going to make japan  one of the centerpieces of our  asia ebs 
      strategy   i think we need to consider devoting more full time ebs 
      regulatory resources to japan exclusively    

       the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply 
       have to focus on  immediate license amendment  and operational
       questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term
       issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications 
       business law  to allow bandwidth trading explicitly    this would seem
       important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy 

5    digital divide

       i had been giving intermittent support to helping scott yeager and 
justin
       cornett of ebs and will reed of technology for all figure out how
       to expand the concept of technology for all to asia    the strategy
       was to utilize some of japans 15 billion pledge of funds to support
       digital divide activities in asia  to support the expansion into asia 
of
       the ebssupported tfa model    this work will cease unless it can 
       be picked up by laura lannarone of corporate social responsbility 
       or steve burns of the dc office

calculation of receipt point capacity
topock  540 mmcfd
ehrenberg 1250 mmcfd
needles 800 mmcfd
wheeler 800 mmcfd

new receipt points
kramer junction 200 mmcfd
hector rd 50 mmcfd
both will be available around feb 1

basis of prorationcurrent windows calculation
currently gas control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system  gas select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations

new calculation changes and display
based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance  socal ist aking and applying the current formula for wheeler ridge to all the points  any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on gas select  customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts  operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections  demand forecast will rely on gas control weather forecast  they use weather bank as one of their tools

ofo declaration
name changes from overnomination
can declare before any cycle
provide 2 hour notice
post on gas select
show ofo calculation on gas select

windows
reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
calculation based on noms which does not work well  lots of complaints   people were complaining that it restricted access to the system  eliminating point specific calculation  open system to max oper limits or contractual limits   will continue to operate wheeler ridge under aug 1 procedures  no changes to wheeler ridge   
due to the need to maintain operational control an ofo will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle  
replace windows with operational maximum volumes  if  cpuc approves comprehensive settlement will post 5 days of information to anticipate ofos
now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows

scheduling changesnov 1
gas select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid2002   no direct dialup     
rollover nomsnoms will be copied from cycle to cycle
copy confirmed noms
all noms will be rolled overwill not be at discretion of 3rd party  however can still make  changes  can still upload new files

2 hour notice
socal will provide 2 hour notice on  gas select of ofo  other methods include leaving message on socal hotline 2132443900 and list of email messages that can go directly to pagers  gas select is official notification  courtesy notification is hot line and e mail  gas select is a subscriber based system mandated by cpuc and must get regulatory change to make free
ofos are going to be system wide and not customer specific  ofos can be declared intraday  once ofo declared it will be kept for entire day  concerned that if call off will have to put back on  dont want to go back and forth  this decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works  many times socal see an increase of 200 mmcfday between cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned  

scheduled vs capacitydeclare ofo
nominations may not exceed 110 of expected usage  
expected usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week  can revise expected usage
no interruptible storage injections allowed during ofo
use elapsed prorata rules
expected usagecut nominations to 110 of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy  generators need to revise expected usage  acceptance of changes are at the discretion of socal
flow day diversions dont go into effect until after cycle 4  gas control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed  
if call ofo after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules
many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised  
if ofo called  interruptible storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows

cycle 1    nom 1000   0 cut
cycle 2 nom 1000 666 cut
cylce 3 nom 1000 500 cut
windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if ofo callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized  will allocate prorata  will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point  in other words if ofo declared during cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles socal will window cycle 4 and prorata cut parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles for penalty purposes actual burn from 12 oclock to 12 oclock will be used to calculate penalties or maxdq if not metered  
for ofo assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week  declare ofo on prior days scheduled volume

for an evening declarationwill use most recent available scheduled volumes  for example

         flow day 104                103 scheduled volumes
cycle 1                                    cycle 2
cycle 2                                     intraday 1
cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 104
cycle 4                                     intraday 1 on 104

in other words will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring ofo on cycle 1 for the 4th look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring ofo for cycle 2 on the 4th  look at evening cycle 2 on 104 in declaraing ofo for cycle 3 on the 4th  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing ofo on cycle 4 for the 4th

judge delays california refund report until march 8

washington sept 25 bloomberg  the judge who will recommend whether enron corp duke energy corp and other power sellers owe california as much as 89 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until march 8

federal energy regulatory commission administrative judge bruce birchman said today that californias grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the octoberthroughjanuary refund period this is the second time he postponed his report birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by nov 5 then delayed it to dec 13

california demanded the refunds charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in california from january to june compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand

im not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because i dont think that refunds are due from anybody enron spokesman mark palmer said

news from the global flash

enron commences authorization process for new power plant in italy
enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power station of up to 1200mw on a 10hectare site 15km from roveleto di cadeo in the comune of cadeo in the province of piacenza northeast italy  the following consents must be received before enrons proposals for a power station can be implemented

 decree of environmental compatibility from the ministry of the environment 
 authorization to construct and operate the plant from the ministry of industry
 all other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections

the authorization process is expected to take around two years such that construction could begin in early 2004 with operation 3036 months from construction start  however the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the italian power and gas markets

 this is the first time one of our italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointlyowned sarlux igcc integrated gasification combined cycle plant in sardinia went into full commercial operation in december 2000 says ross sankey who is leading enrons cadeo project team  were pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities

gasmarktfax stirs trouble in german incumbentdominated gas market
following on from a recent globalflash report on the launch of gasmarktfax by the german origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the german gas market  

european spot gas markets reported on thursday 13 september that ruhrgas will decrease prices for their stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 october  the article mentions that it is clear that ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last months release of enrons gasmarktfax provided stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to enron offers  pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs said helgejurgen beil director with the german origination team who lead the gasmarktfax initiative  however it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position  grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice helgejurgen added

enron signs first trading deal in poland
enrons polish team have signed the companys first ever trading deal in the country  which is also the first transaction entered into by a polish power trading company based on the efet european federation of energy traders master trading agreement

the 50mw deal is with pke currently polands largest generator by installed capacity responsible for around 17 of total energy production in poland

the deal with pke is effectively a series of 51 call options each one of them being a separate option for 50mw of baseload power for any given calendar month enron is the buyer of this series of options the first month for which enron will have a call option will be october 2001 and the last will be december 2005 the exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month the strike prices follow a predetermined schedule

this pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in poland declares jarek dybowski enrons director of power trading in poland

this deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in poland adds jarek astramowicz enrons vicepresident and head of the polish office  a big thank you to jarek dybowski tomasz krzyzewski sid cox marcus zwinger pat cini and jason clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible

ebs celebrates neos deal
congratulations to ebs who secured a deal with neos a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within london and other uk cities known as metro connectivity the transaction gives enron instant access to londons metro network which expands enrons coverage the agreement involves a  3 million take or pay commitment over ten years with enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity
 
marcello romano vice president bandwidth trading is delighted we needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices

launch of nordic precipitation index
in another first for enron this week saw the launch by enron nordic energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations  the index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity  given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the nordic region the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers  the index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions  for the large hydro producers the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall  the index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the nordic region with 27 locations in all 19 in norway and 8 in sweden

on the very day of the index launch we were able to announce the completion of a deal with norsk hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling norsk hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the nordic region  

given the amount of hydroproduction in the nordic region  approximately 99 116twhyr in norway and 50 64twhyr in sweden  the index is likely to be of significant interest in the nordic market  in norway and sweden about 70 of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10 from normal and by up to 30 during extreme years  the subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers

makes him a risky start from a fantasy perspective  steve mcnair  qb ten  rocks updated 111601 mcnairs status is still in question for sundays game against cincinnati due to an injured right thumb he threw the ball during individual drills friday and according to published reports is likely to play despite not being 100 percent we dont recommend mcnair this week as a result  emmitt smith  rb dal  rocks updated 111601 smit h  will return to the lineup sunday against philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee cowboys head coach dave campo said after fridays practice that smith would be ready to play the majority of the game his return bumps troy hambrick to fullback but we wouldnt recommend you use either back against the stingy eagles rush defense  frank sanders  wr ari  baja updated 111601 sanders hamstring was added to the nfl injury report on friday and is now listed as questionable for sundays game against detroit  however if youre completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week sanders matchup against a vulnerable detroit secondary is worth considering as long as hes able to play    chris weinke  qb car  free agent updated 111601 according to published reports weinke will be the starting quarterback for sundays game against san francisco however hes not worth starting on your fantasy team   daunte culpepper  qb min  hunter shively updated 111601 culpepper is one pace for a good fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in minnesotas offense this season hes one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a fantasy perspective and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis   cris carter  wr min  matt lenhart updated 111601 carters numbers may be down somewhat this season but hes still too good to ever consider benching the veteran has a knack for finding the end zone and should have a good game against rookie cb will allen and the giants secondary on monday night   randy moss  wr min  hunter shively updated 111601 moss is listed as probable for mondays game against the ny giants due to an ankle injury hes been underachieving this season but its almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid fantasy num be rs   ricky williams  rb no  free agent updated 111601 williams is one of the better fantasy backs in the league and is a good player to use on a weekly basis hell face an indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long so williams is a muststart     aaron brooks  qb no  free agent updated 111601 brooks had a big game against san francisco last weekend throwing for 347 yards and two scores he may be a bit inconsistent this season but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him especially against a vulne ra ble indianapolis defense    willie jackson  wr no  free agent updated 111601 jackson put up a huge game against san francisco last weekend posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving hell face a questionable indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in week 10 so starting jackson this week is a solid option   stephen davis  rb was  matt lenhart updated 111601 davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly hes averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games and is once again emerging as a reliable fantasy player give him the start in week 10 against a denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games   tony banks  qb was  matt lenhart updated 111601 banks has played well of late throwing five touchdowns in his last three games hes got a good matchup this weekend against a denver team that can be beaten through the air but hes only worth considering in very deep fantasy leagues   michael westbrook  wr was  free agent updated 111601 westbrook has been inconsistent this season but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games hell face a denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering   rod gardner  wr was  free agent updated 111601 gardner has been held in check in his last two games catching only three passes for 38 yards he does have a favorable matchup this weekend against denver however so starting him is a good move   azzahir hakim  wr stl  fibsabs  updated 111601 hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks so starting him on your fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right hell go up against a tough new england secondary in week ten so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues   torry holt  wr stl  fear updated 111601 holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals but hes only scored only three touchdowns this season hell face a tough new england secondary this weekend but hes still worth starting on your fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers   isaac br uc   wr stl  matt lenhart updated 111601 bruce hasnt put up the huge fantasy totals this season but hes still one of the better wideouts in the league hell face cb ty law and the formidable new england secondary but hes still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers   marshall faulk  rb stl  mckay neal updated 111601 faulk had a huge game against carolina proving that he is still the best fantasy player in the league hes a muststart every week and should post solid numbers in week 10 against new england   ernie c onwell   te stl  free agent updated 111601 conwell has had a few down weeks so starting him on your fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble with the lack of depth at tight end around the league however starting conwell is something many fantasy owners will have no choice but to do   richard huntley  rb car  free agent updated 111601 huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against san francisco but dont be surprised if he splits carries with nick goings avoid starting either back in week 10 if at all possible   donald hayes  wr  ca r  eric bass updated 111601 hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against st louis hes been unreliable for fantasy owners this season so starting him is a real gamble    wesley walls  te car  tori kuykendall updated 111601 walls has been held in check over

updated 111601 muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game catching six passes for 75 yards against st louis hes had some success in the past against this weeks opponent san francisco so starting him is a decent move   brett favre  qb gb  the klap updated 111601 favre has been one of the best fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season hell face an atlanta team on sunday with a very vulnerable secondary so be sure to start favre this week   bubba franks  te gb  free agent updated 111601 franks may not put up huge yardage numbers b ut his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him

aol offers bounty on subscribers

not only onscreen icons for signups but also popup notices
and other messages according to the washington post aols
actions are unprecedented and completely anticonsumer
microsoft spokesman vivek varma told the post aol is paying
computer makers to eliminate consumer choice forcing people
to select the most expensive service in the industry

aols goal is greater visibility for its online and instant
messaging services and netscape browser this is a forthright
step into being able to market to consumers in ways that
because of microsofts monopoly aol has not been able to market
previously aol vice president john buckley told the post

below is what i am proposing as a response to kal and andys concerns over 
the ice claim most liquid  let me know your thoughts

thanks


attorney client communication
attorney work product
confidential communication

kal 

i understand the concern raised however i am not so sure that the claim 
made is a legal claim  the analysis of whether or not this type of claim 
can be made is really based upon advertising principals and generally at 
least at a federal level governed by the federal trade commission  the 
analysis of the validity of the claim is the concern in this arena and would 
focus predominantly on an analysis of the following items

1  whether or not this type of language is puffery for sales purposes or 
if it is a claim requiring substantiation
2  what the term most liquid is intended to convey eg eol uses 
worlds largest to convey both size and power in the market
3  how most liquid is defined  what standard measure or industry 
analysis has been conducted by ice to establish that most liquid has a real 
meaning and one that when applied to eol would indicate that eol is not as 
liquid as ice 
4  whether or not the use of the term most liquid is misleading thereby 
causing any harm

notice that the advertising analysis will not focus on perceived damage by 
enron based upon restricted access  this analysis at least to me would be 
a separate and distinct issue  if enron is not being given full access to 
the site simply because there is no equity ownership the analysis of damage 
to enron would be moreso a possible antitrust type analysis by the department 
of justicecourts rather than a false advertising type analysis  this 
analysis would be based upon issues related to the ownership structure of the 
site including the sharing of profits and fees amongst owners the policies 
and procedures established by ice to ensure fair treatment to all who access 
the site and the effect restricted access may have upon competition eg 
other sites being able to enter the market and compete  the last point 
would also have as a component  the extent to which enron and other 
nonowner users would not have a secondary or alternative source for the 
information

needless to say it may be difficult under the antitrust type analysis for 
enron to claim harm when eol boast of being the worlds largest website for 
global commodity transactions  further if other noneol sources are 
available to enron to obtain the same information contained within ice it 
would also be difficult for enron to show harm as a result of limited access

                     by mark golden 

                     new york dow jones the credit problems of the 
california independent system operator reflect the
                     credit problems of the states three investorowned 
utilities enron corp ene chief of staff steven kean
                     said wednesday 
                      
                      
                     we have expressed some concerns about the utilities 
creditworthiness kean said they wouldnt have
                     this credit issue if they had a government guarantee 

                     standard  poors credit analyst for california 
utilities richard cortright told dow jones newswires that
                     such a guarantee is highly unlikely 

                     theres no point in talking about it cortright said 

                     the creditrating agency put california utility holding 
companies pge corp pcg and edison
                     international eix on watch with negative implications 
wednesday the utilities have seen their debt
                     rating downgraded already this fall but their debts are 
piling up by the billions as they continue to pay
                     about 10 times more for power supplies than they can 
charge customers 

                     the sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is 
beyond belief cortright said wholesale prices
                     have gotten worse and every hour the situation gets 
more dire 

                     cortright said the only step that would save the 
utilities credit status is if california regulators raised the
                     rates the utilities can charge customers 

                     late wednesday the california public utilties 
commission indicated that it may do so reversing a
                     decision made just last week 

                     with new generation coming on you would expect the 
rates to decline in a couple of years cortright
                     said 

                     the california independent system operator almost had to 
institute rolling blackouts wednesday
                     because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to 
concerns about the isos credit 

                     california gov gray davis said that enron was one of 
the dirty 13 

                     enrons kean said that enron was only offering very 
limited amounts of power to the iso 

                     we are basically just a buyer and seller we control 
only 70 megawatts of generation in the state which
                     we offered to the iso today because of the emergency 
but the iso declined to purchase that power
                     kean said 

                     that small generating unit is located in the southern 
california while the isos supply problems were
                     most acute in northern california 

                     we arent selling any other power to them right now 
everything else that we bought weve sold to other
                     buyers said kean who added that enron had sold to the 
iso as recently as tuesday 

                     the iso manages californias electricity grid and 
purchases lastminute additional power on behalf of the
                     states three investorowned utilities the iso then 
bills the utilities which are pge corps pacific gas

california edison and sempra energys sre san
                     diego gas  electric co 

                     the iso has 70day payment terms to suppliers 

                     for the past two weeks and often during the summer the 
iso has been purchasing about onefourth of
                     the states entire needs at very high prices its 
current daily power purchases are running at 50 million to
                     100 million

"generate subject: houston  enron corp hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in 
houston  ken lay enron chairman and chief executive officer opened the 
conference by highlighting enrons tremendous growth across all businesses 
and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade
enron presented key objectives for 2000
 continued strong growth in the core wholesale energy businesses
 breakout performance from retail energy services
 rapid development of enron broadband services

enrons ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a 
recurring theme throughout the day

wholesale energy business
growth prospects remain strong for wholesale energy operations and services 
enrons largest business  wholesale energy growth in north america is 
expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the 
united states and largescale energy outsourcing by utilities and large 
energy consumers  enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across 
the european continent as markets quickly open to competition  finally 
enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as 
japan where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity 
provider in march 2000
enrononline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are 
generated through this innovative internetbased transaction system  over 
450 customers around the world have used enrononline and over 10000 
transactions have been completed since its introduction in late november 
1999  yesterday enrononline transaction levels reached a new record with 
over 700 transactions representing a notional value of 250 million  
transaction processing costs with enrononline are significantly lower than 
costs associated with traditional transaction methods
enrons gas pipeline group is also well positioned to continue growing with 
expansions planned or underway on several of its systems

retail energy services
with over 16500 facilities under management the infrastructure is in place 
to service customers worldwide  as the strong contracting momentum 
continues enron energy services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 
2000  enron energy services goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts 
representing 16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and 
energy services nearly double the level in 1999

enron broadband services
the new name of enrons communications business enron broadband services 
reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband 
services  enron is deploying an open flexible global broadband network 
controlled by software intelligence which precludes the need to invest in a 
traditional pointtopoint fiber network  this enron intelligent network is 
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to 
internet service providers thus providing the platform for two new enron 
business centers bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery
a direct transfer of enrons core market making and risk management skills 
from its energy businesses bandwidth intermediation will provide 
capacityholders a vast array of alternatives for flexible low cost 
capacity  enron will also provide premium broadband content services such 
as highquality videostreaming and large broadband file transfer with 
differentiated levels of quality in a usagebased business model
as announced in a separate release enron also reached an agreement with sun 
microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband internet 
services
enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and 
communications companies  the company which owns approximately 34 billion 
in energy and communications assets produces electricity and natural gas 
develops constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide delivers 
physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers 
around the world and is developing an intelligent network platform to 
facilitate online business  enrons internet address is  and 
the stock is traded under the ticker symbol ene8

this press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of 
section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities 
exchange act of 1934 although enron believes that its expectations are based 
on reasonable assumptions it can give no assurance that its goals will be 
achieved  important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include 
political developments in foreign countries the ability to penetrate new

tax lobbyingjordan mintz and terry thorn are proposing a series of meetings 
with government officials in late february and have asked carlos bastos to 
see if he can also arrange a meeting with mr lenicov at that time  issues 
include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be 
lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level  there is a 
proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the vat 
tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax  the focus of 
the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who

transportation capacity release guidelinesmust review and comment on new

vandenfilvandenfil has filed for a prebankruptcy proceeding which has not 
yet been opened by the court due to the january recess  for the last three 
months vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending them
termination notices with a two business day cure period    the most likely
scenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will 
be continued by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing 
deliveries of gas  after the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not 
been served notice that our contract is continued within 30 days we would 
be allowed to terminate the contract  one of the risks that we face with 
this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate 
the contract claiming we are providing a public service

imasa bidformat of enrons original proposal structure changed  enron and 
albanesi submitted joint termsheet to central puerto in november  where enron 
proposed signing two contracts with central puerto one for the supply of all 
the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas 
requirements and albanesi proposed two contracts one for supplying 40 
percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline 
spur  central puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of 
january 25 1999

dow pipeline spur feasibility studyenron and dow are studying the 
feasibility of building a pipeline between tgs and two affiliates of dow 
issues include determining whether our ceiasa shareholder and owners 
agreements preclude enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs 
that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory 
guidelines  andrea will be putting together a short report based on her 
meeting with nestor martinez   a team meeting consisting of legal 
regulatory commercial credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the 
broad parameters of the dow spur proposal  the commercial group is preparing 
a first draft of a build operate and finance termsheet that they would like 
to present to the customer on thursday to be reviewed by robert george

response weve received we will continue to add events and will
continue this auction for the foreseeable future  to the

consumers union to study web credibility

the publisher of consumer reports magazine said walt disney cos
abcnewscom veteran beau brendler will head up an effort to set
up credibility standards for the web the consumers unions web
credibility project will evaluate the information on web sites
and report what it finds

this project has enormously ambitious goals brendler said in a
statement and now more than ever with web ventures shutting
down every week consumers need to know that the sites they are
relying on for news vital information and business transactions
arent hiding anything and are doing their jobs in an honest
credible way

consumers union said the project grew out of  a 1998 conference
at which print and new media journalists agreed there was a need
to create effective standards to measure editorial quality and
the separation between editorial and advertising content on the
web

point in somerset northeast utilities mount tom station and mirants canal 
electric in sandwich

although massachusetts has emissions trading and averaging rules the new 
regulations prohibit use of emissions averaging between the plants to meet 
the standards local citizens environmental groups and elected officials 
protested such averaging because they feared that pge national energy group 
would use reductions from its salem mass plant to offset emissions at its 
fall river brayton point facility creating what they described as a burden 
of air pollution in fall river

the rules do however allow plants to generate so2 early reduction 
credits by operating below historical average emission rates a generating 
facility can use the ercs to meet the new standards but cannot transfer the 
ercs to another facility

the dep also will allow transfer of so2 allowances under the federal acid 
rain program the dep noted that the plants will be emitting at rates lower 
than what the epa requires to create allowances therefore the plants are 
likely to create a substantial number of unused allowances if the plants 
transfer the allowances to upwind sources it could harm air quality in 
massachusetts the dep plans to monitor the situation and may limit the 
ability of the plants to accumulate the allowances if they are having an 
adverse impact on massachusetts

the rules allow use of offsite reductions and carbon sequestration to comply 
with the co2 cap in the future it also plans to allow co2 trading and will 
set up a massachusetts greenhouse gas reductions registry to promote 
reductions and create consistency in their creation

the dep decided against issuing a standard for fine particulate matter for 
the time being saying there is currently insufficient technical 
information to support a standard and that the nox and so2 reductions will 
automatically reduce pm concentrations

while the regulations won praise from several environmental groups the 
competitive power coalition of new england warned that they may jeopardize 
reliability increase consumer costs and reduce fuel diversity

cpc says that the state went back on its original proposal announced about a 
year ago which was supported by the plant owners plant owners offered 
voluntary emissions reductions with the understanding that if they did the 
state would not institute new regulations

the dep however said that not all of the power plant owners submitted 
detailed voluntary plans and further the state agency said that it had made 
clear that it would incorporate the voluntary proposals in new regulations

cpc said that the original proposals also did not include co2 or mercury 
limits and did not prohibit averaging moreover the state originally agreed 
to give plant owners several more years to comply setting deadlines of 2007 
and 2010 to meet reductions according to neal costello cpc general counsel 
instead the final rules call for the plants to achieve the standards between 
oct 1 2004 and oct 1 2008 plants that repower are given more time than 
those that install emissions pollution control technologies

specifically plants that repower have until oct 1 2006 to reduce nox by 
15 lbsmwh using a 12 month rolling average and so2 to 6 lbsmwh by 2008 
they must reduce so2 to 3 lbsmwh plants that do not repower have until oct 
1 2004 to meet the first so2 and nox standards and until oct 1 2006 to 
meet the final so2 standard for co2 plants must limit emissions to 1800 
lbsmwh by oct 1 2006 if they install emissions reductions devices and 
two years later if they repower

the dep said it is giving plants more time if they repower because it will 
take them longer to complete design permitting and construction its worth 
the wait the dep said because repowering reduces multiple pollutants

cpcs costello said that the regulations will increase power costs at about 
the same time that the state is scheduled to end discounted utility standard 
offer service which is taken by about 80 of the states electricity 
consumers the customers will then buy power at market prices which are 
likely to rise as the generators pass on the cost of the environmental 
upgrades

power plant owners have also said that the tight time frames could jeopardize 
system reliability because it may force plants offline simultaneously 
however the dep argued that the region will not be short of supply because 
10000 mw in new capacity will come on line by 2003",ma becomes first state to impose  co2 controls,mass becomes first state to impose co2 controls under tough new standards

in an intensive branding and imaging campaign to appropriately 
communicate what it means to be a graduate of the mays college and of 
texas am university to do so i have asked a wellknown marketing 
and branding consultant and former student mr brandon coleman 78

thus far we have met with current students faculty staff 
corporate recruiters and our colleges advisory boards to get their 
thoughts now it is time to reach out to you as a graduate of this 
college and ask for your valuable opinions

you have undoubtedly reflected upon your texas am university 
experience and have personally seen the value of your business 
degree please share your reflections with us
   what does being a business graduate from texas am mean to you
   what should it mean
   how are we at the mays college different

us communicate more effectively to others the uniqueness of the 
educational experience of the mays college at texas am

to mr ken lay

im writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling enron stock before the company declared
bankruptcy to funds such as enron employee transition fund and
reach that benefit the companys employees who lost their
retirement savings and provide relief to lowincome consumers in
california who cant afford to pay their energy bills  enron
and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of california
consumers and from the efforts of your employees

indeed while you netted well over a 100 million many of
enrons employees were financially devastated when the company
declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out
and enron made an astronomical profit during the california
energy crisis last year  as a result there are thousands of
consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the
largest utility in the state is bankrupt

the new york times reported that you sold 101 million worth of
enron stock while aggressively urging the companys employees to
keep buying it  please donate this money to the funds set up to
help repair the lives of those americans hurt by enrons
underhanded dealings

sincerely

that point i wanted to recap my understanding of the next steps  ed 
gottlob melissa graves rita wynne and clem cernosek will work together to 
pull data to view hplcs total transport business and then balance it to the 
offsystem interconnect business used in the texas trading operation  this 
perspective when all elements are accounted for and tied out should result 
in the accounting ua4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger  
they will focus as the core team and will enlist others as needed which 
might include gas accounting settlements lisa csikos or others  
additionally johnnie has offered assistance from her team but feels the 
project of tieing the data best resides in energy operations  they will need 
to determine their course of action and schedule a followup meeting with 
the group when they have some data to share

i want to reiterate  we all understand the importance of this project and 
will do everything possible to support it  these 4 people will remove 
themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this fulltime  we 
felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively 
rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities  it is crucial that 
everyone take ownership in the results

us feb ism nonmfg survey form napm exp 51 prev 496  the yen challenged overnight 2week highs of 13180 against the dollar and pushed to a days high of 11440 against the euro despite upbeat economic data from the us and eurozone over the past week yen strength is based on hopes and fears and not sound economic fundamentals but the dollars recent failure to benefit from strong data and wall streets surge has left bulls feeling uncertain therefore currencies continue to trade familiar ranges with trends hard to find  the european majors gave back some of their overnight gains against the dollar despite positive services pmi data from the eurozone and uk e12 services index expanded for the second month in a row rising to 515 in february from 510 new business also rose to 506 from 497 indicating the first rise in new business since the summer the news raises hopes that a eurozone economic recovery is around the corner the data showed france and italy leading the recovery while the rate of decline eased in germany   more importantly unemployment improved to 84 in january despite how weak output has been coupled with stronger than expected e12 pmi data and a further gain in consumer confidence the ecb is expected to keeps rates unchanged at 325 on thursday in fact financial markets are already pricing in a quarter percentage point ecb rate rise by june the german diw institute head also doesnt expect more ecb rate cuts in this cycle saying the next move is up  bank of france head jeanclaude trichet reiterated on tuesday his view that a strong euro was in the best interests of the euro zone economy but traders were hard to convince as they pushed eurusd to a days low of 8673 after twice failing to maintain above 87 cents the pair gave up overnight gains and could fall back towards last weeks 3week low of 8625 if it is unable to break resistance at 8715 traders are not encouraged by eurozone prospects and sentiment is again turning bearish enough to target a move through 863015 on its way to its 6month low of 8563 but technical indicators are mixed support is seen at 8660 8630 8615 and 8560 resistance is viewed at 8710 and 8785  gbpusd also fell to a days low of 14204 after twice failing to break strong resistance seen at 14240 resistance is eyed at 14240 14280 and 1430 support holds at 14180 and 14130 a break of 14110 would put 14045 under pressure and be seen as a bearish signal sterling was also unable to leverage good services pmi data into gains after britains dominant services sector expanded for the second month running in february to 515 from 510 the figures also support the consensus estimate that the boe which also meets on thursday will keep rates unchanged this week at a 38year low of 40 percent  moreover indications from todays pmi data show that both input prices and prices charged in the uk and e12 have fallen over the last month which will reassure central bank members that monetary tightening to contain inflation is not a pressing concern  meanwhile jpy resumed its recent rise and targeted the key 13185 mark against the dollar today for the second time this week its difficult to ascribe a good fundamental reason from the strength but traders attribute it to mondays 59 rise in the nikkei to a 6month high of 11450 repatriation fears and hopes that japan may finally tackle its nonperforming loan problems recent measures to support japanese asset prices also gives japans capitalweak banks a needed if artificial or temporary boost ahead of mark to market fiscal year end on march 31  were usdjpy to break key support at 1320013180 it would have a bearish implication for the pair and would open up a downside target of 13045 but the recent sell off may have bottomed again at the 13180 mark where stop loss orders are being protected upside capped at 1330 13350 and 13370 1340010 1347085 and strong resistance at 13515 support holds at 13220 and 13180  despite usd losses across the board on monday us stocks soared on hope that the us economy is on the verge of recovery based on recent affirmative economic data the dow skyrocketed 21 or 217 points to 10586 and nasdaq rose 31 or 56 points to 1859 therefore dealers will look to see what todays services pmi data says in us both european figures showed modest gains after breaking back above the 50 mark into expansion in january us nonmanufacturing ism survey is expected to break above the key 50level to 510 in february from the previous 496 thereby indicating growth in the services sector while this is a positive

since my move it is likely that i will not be attending this workshop  i have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of eisb  although i have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop there was a possibility that i would be speaking on behalf of epsa  the meeting is a critical juncture for the eisb vs nerc showdown   nerc will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model  i and other epsa members have been advocating much fewer sectors for eisb  a key point of the nerc proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an eisb approval process for standards  this is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between nerc expertiseinfrastructure and eisbs reknowned including ferc consensus building process  nerc could retain its standards development expertise however lose its biased voting process

i think it is important to have coverage for this meeting either by someone on the nerc team or someone close to nerc in washington  the likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the nerc approach or a clean slate eisb approach

at our meeting this past monday carol balassa ustr told us that she would
be sending to us for comment a matrixconcordance of the commercial
activities and commercial descriptions that the esc provided the usg this
past spring our illustrative lists with the system used by the wto to
classify services the provisional central product classification cpc and
the gats own classification document w120  that matrix is attached below
also attached is a document that describes the meaning of the various cpc
classifications so that you may interpret more accurately the matrix
prepared by the usg  the materials largely were prepared by the itc which
has done yeomans work and deserves our thanks
the purpose of these materials is to see where our activities fall within
the wto gats classification system

the immediate task for us is to try to answer various questions the usg
interagency team has about the types of activities we have told them our
sector does  these questions are in boxes along the lefthand margin of the
text  they often ask us for clarifications about what we have said we do
and to provide specific examples  beyond that if there are elements on
which you have questionscomments we should give that feedback back to
ustr

the esc executive committee would appreciate it if all members would look at
the questions and send us any guidance they can on issues of relevance to
their companiesassociations  we also would ask that the chairs of the
various working groups hydrocarbons electricity technology and
renewables particularly look at the document to see if they need to get
their working groups together to review the questions and our responses

carol noted that these same documents will be submitted to the isacs for
comment  for those of you who are on the isacs it will help carol and her
team if we can note where there might be a duplication in the comments
provided by the esc and various isac members who also are esc members

please direct all commentsquestions to bob fisher at hills  company  his
phone number is 202 8224700  his email address is

i spoke to joe wright at apb this morning  here is the rub on this matter

  apb has a 500k lc outstanding to cover the us trading
  norwegin energy brokers  as is a brokerage house trading in nordiceu areas mostly in scandinavian countries
  first energy brokers  as was formed by neb for purposes of trading in the netherlands not sure of the timing
  neb owns a large stake in feb but not all of the entity
  apb is currently a 23 owner of neb thus indirectly owning a piece of feb
  apb is looking to purchase the balance of the ownership of neb which is confidential seeking to close sometime later this month
  joe indicated his thought that postneb purchase there is a good chance that neb and feb will be merged
  joe also indicated that it would not be a problem for the apb lc to be expanded to these entities  if this is what credit would need

i do not know if we have any history with either neb or feb but i am sure we need to talk to credit to figure out what is needed in order for the trading to take place  can you follow this up or do you want me to do so

"generate subject: as you are aware enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy 
staffing requirements throughout the company  for the past several months a 
project team representing enrons temporary staffing users have researched

as a result of the teams efforts we are pleased to announce the beginning 
of a strategic alliance with corestaffs managed services group  this group 
will function as a vendorneutral management entity overseeing all staffing

we plan to implement phase i of this improvement effective january 2 2001  
this phase i of the implementation will encompass administrativeclerical 
temporary workers at the houston locations only if you currently have 
administrativeclerical temporary workers in your department the enhancement 
will not affect their position in an effort to preserve relationships all 
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced 
program  corestaff shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in 
service during this transition 
 
we expect to incorporate the administrativeclerical workers in omaha 
seattle and portland in phase ii which is scheduled for february 2001  the 
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two 
phases have been completed

realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today we 
selected corestaffs managed services group based on their exceptional 
management team commitment to quality service and creative solutions to our 
staffing needs  the relationship promises to offer enron a cost effective 
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees

in the coming weeks enron and corestaffs managed services group will be 
communicating to enrons administrativeclerical temporary staffing vendors 
about the new process  

there are many benefits to this new managed services program which are 
outlined on the attached page  more details on how to utilize corestaffs

"generate subject: yesterday pge sent out by emailthe attachedadvice letter  filed last 
wednesday 2057e which proposes toimplement revisions to all  electric 
rate schedules and preliminary statements to change the companys rates  and 
to bill customers based on pges flawed contention that the ab 1890  rate 
freeze has ended based on accounting entries in its transition cost  
balancing account tcba pge says it completed recovery of its transition  
costs sometime before august 31 2000 thus ending the rate freeze 

this advice letter and the accompanyingtariff changesare said  to be filed 
in compliance with d0006034 d0003058 and d9910057 in the  
posttransition electric ratemaking pter proceeding a 9901016  
however i believe it conflicts directly with the end of the rate freeze  
mechanism which was specified in that proceeding 

the august date for ending the rate freeze is based on the valuation of  pge
s retained hydro assets of 28 billion as included in the companys  
generation asset balancing account gaba filing effective june 23 2000 
as  filed in advice letters 2048e and 2049e dated october 26 2000 
based  on current market conditions pge believes the actual value will be  
determined to be higher than 28 billion if this is the case the rate  
freeze will have ended earlier and the tariffs contained herein will be  
revised if the actual value of such generation is lawfully determined to  
be lower pge says it will not seek recovery of any resulting  
undercollected ctc

this should be protested as it is an obvious effort to get out from under  
their current purchased power undercollections at the expense of their  
ratepayers by making a spurious claim that the rate freeze has ended  
there is no date specified for comments but assuming the usual 20 days 
that  means protests are due on december 12

enron warns of problems eroding profit

copyright c 2001 dow jones  company inc
enron corp warned that continuing credit worries a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourthquarter earnings 
the energy company said it may be forced to take a 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships the partnership whitewing llp held assets with a book value of 47 billion on nov 16 but a drop in the value of enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of 700 million the company said
in addition enron houston said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a 690 million note that note became a demand obligation on nov 12 when enrons credit rating got lowered to triplebminus by standard  poors the company didnt disclose who holds the note 
weve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets said company spokesman mark palmer one of the assets includes ceg rio a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash 
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and in some cases to keep debt off its balance sheet in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct 31 the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet 
the company on nov 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening the petition alleges that enrons directors breached their fiduciary duties to enrons shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron enron said it would vigorously defend itself 
yesterdays filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses in its original thirdquarter statement the company reported a loss of 618 million the stated loss was increased to 635 million last week and in the latest filing the loss for the quarter ended sept 30 was widened to 664 million 
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing arent necessarily final because its external auditor arthur andersen hasnt completed its review nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firms accounting practices

senior wall street bankers are concerned that dynegy could walk away from its proposed 98bn  68bn rescue bid for its rival energy group enron  a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets 
in a series of interviews with the financial times bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for dynegy to pull out some of the companys shareholders were under the impression that the material adverse change clause could be triggered
there is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen or even likely to happen one banker said and the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good he added none of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified 
the possibility of dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from jp morgan chase and citigroup which are advising enron met with officials from moodys the credit rating agencies 10 days ago 
the rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for dynegy to give up its bid further undermining enrons creditworthiness 
moodys decision to preserve enrons investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid 
in justifying the allstock bid chuck watson chairman of dynegy said last week that buying the company for a low price  a fraction of enrons market capitalisation at its peak in 2000  was a major protection against failure 
but he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with moodys had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose 
according to dynegy the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enrons finances possible litigation against the energy company balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts

enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter 
690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm 
by tom fowler 
copyright 2001 houston chronicle 
enron corps financial wellbeing continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings monday 
in a securities and exchange commission filing enron said it reduced thirdquarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors 
the company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a 690 million note by nov 27 if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt 
the revelations came in the embattled energy traders 10q document which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet enron delayed releasing the 10q by five days and said the filing made monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm andersen because of an ongoing investigation by the companys board of directors and the need for more time 
we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation said william k powers jr chairman of enrons special investigation committee and dean of the university of texas school of law 
enrons pending 690 million iou is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in brazil one of the terms of the partnership requires enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to bbb on rating agency standard  poors scale which it did nov 12 if enron doesnt put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnerships assets 
enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt 
if enrons debt rating continues to drop which would put it below investment grade the company would face another 39 billion in debt repayments the company said in the filing mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years 24 billion owed by osprey trust and 915 million by marlin water trust 
enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies but a cash infusion from dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible 500 million to 1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat 
the turmoil around enrons finances started after oct 16 when steep losses in its thirdquarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the companys board of directors 
the ljm partnerships were formed using enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the companys new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the companys stock 
the cfos dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an sec investigation as well as an internal enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 12 years by nearly 600 million 
those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in enron which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating the company eventually reached a deal with rival dynegy to be acquired for almost 9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost 13 billion in debt and 2 billion in preferred stock 
the fallout from enrons crumble is spreading to its major service providers including andersen that firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit while on monday rep john dingell dmich called for an investigation of andersen in connection with its audits of enron and houstonbased waste management 
the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting dingell wrote in a letter to the public oversight board requesting the investigation 
andersen based in chicago has a large houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients including enron and dynegy critics of andersen have said the firm should have done more as enrons auditor to draw investors attention to the companys unusual finances 
a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged andersens judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from enron while it was auditor 
in june andersen was fined 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management the largest civil penalty against a big five accounting firm andersen did not admit or deny the charges

enron corp warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a 690million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal thirdquarter earnings 
the energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the 690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships
if the debt isnt paid the partner could liquidate the partnerships assets which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise 250 million in cash 
enron has already used up its 3billion credit line secured roughly 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash 
the company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share according to its filing with the securities and exchange commission that would put its loss at 87 cents a share

us official calls for probe of andersen 2 problem audits

washington  concerned about the accounting professions ability to police itself a senior house of representatives democrat has called for a special investigation of arthur andersen llp and its audits of enron corp and waste management inc 
in a letter to us public oversight board chairman charles bowsher released monday rep john dingell a michigan democrat requested a review of andersens audits of enron and waste management two highprofile audit failures
enron of houston which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival dynergy inc acknowledged it overstated net income by 586 million 6625 million euros and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997 
the us securities and exchange commission is investigating enrons treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former chief financial officer andrew fastow 
enrons problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for andersen in june the firm reached a 7 million settlement with the sec in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of waste management 
andersen and the waste hauler paid 220 million in 1999 to settle classaction lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated waste managements reported earnings in the mid1990s 
in addition to the secs probe of its role in the enron matter andersen is undergoing routine peer review by deloitte  touche dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that deloitte  touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of enrons board of directors 
given the potential conflict of interest on the part of deloitte  touche and andersens track record there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process mr dingell wrote

in new filing enron reports debt squeeze
by richard a oppel jr and floyd norris

11202001
the new york times
page 1 column 2
c 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash it said that if any of a number of things went wrong its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question 
in a delayed quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission the company said that it would have to repay 690 million in debt by next tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan
enron has about 175 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of 915 billion by the end of next year the report for the third quarter which was filed five days late says the company faces immediate demand for 39 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further 
enrons independent auditors with the firm of arthur andersen have not been able to complete their review of enrons financial statements for the third quarter andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of enrons books related to enrons disclosure this month that it had overstated almost 600 million in profits in the last five years enron has said that it will restate statements that andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon 
yesterday representative john d dingell of michigan the ranking democrat on the house energy and commerce committee called for an investigation into arthur andersens handling of the enron audits a spokesman for andersen could not be reached last night 
enron the nations largest energy trader has agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc its smaller crosstown rival in houston and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of enron which is now at the lowest investmentgrade rating any downgrades could lead to a collapse of enrons core energy trading business analysts say as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with enron entirely 
the dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year and the disclosures yesterday indicate that enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next september 
enron is in talks to obtain 500 million to 1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions in addition executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell 800 million in assets by the end of the year and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year enron is also set to receive a 1 billion infusion from chevrontexaco which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy if the deal closes next year 
still even after factoring in cash flow from enrons core energytrading operations enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year  meaning that enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities 
carol coale an analyst for prudential securities in houston said the new disclosures indicated that enrons troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with dynegy was announced 
our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank ms coale said but now it sounds like enrons problems were actually more inherent than perceived 
enrons deal with dynegy calls for enron holders to receive 02685 dynegy share for each enron share but in trading since the deal was announced enrons share price has lagged dynegys price reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms 
in new york stock exchange trading yesterday before the enron filing was released enron rose 6 cents to 906 and dynegy rose 113 to 4360 at those prices the value of the dynegy offer is 292 percent above enrons share price compared with a 206 percent difference when the deal was announced 
some debts that enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further and the merger agreement with dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger  currently 1171 an enron share 
in afterhours trading yesterday after the release of the enron filing the share price slipped to 9 
enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than 500 million yesterdays filing provided some additional details on enrons relationships with various related partnerships whose debts enron could be forced to pay and it said that additional writeoffs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined it said that because enrons stock value had fallen one writedown could be 700 million 
the disclosures show that enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet 
but the collapse of enrons stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts 
it is not possible to predict enron warned investors whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful an adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on enrons ability to continue as a going concern

decision to locate conocophillips in houston enhances worlds energy capital

houston ap  the decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of phillips petroleum co and conoco inc in houston home of the smaller conoco helps cement the citys status as the nations energy capital 
houston already was the energy capital of the world this just proves it said mark baxter director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university in dallas
all the major players are in houston and houston can accommodate the employee growth base he said it is easier to conduct the business in the houston market because not only are all the major companies there all the support is in houston as well 
the dlrs 156 billion deal announced sunday that would create the nations third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for houston even though the nations two largest oil companies  irvingbased exxonmobil and san franciscobased chevrontexaco  have their headquarters located elsewhere each has thousands of employees working in the nations fourthlargest city 
it all began with the 1901 spindletop strike in southeast texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental united states vast oil resources lay beneath texas soil 
historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries said david bole the vice president of randall  dewey inc a houstonbased oil consulting firm but certainly with highspeed communications developed over the last 30 years the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers 
what has set houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters their vision and their ability to build megacompanies in many cases it is their legacy that has built houston into todays oil capital 
shell oil co is based in houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling oil field services pipeline oil field firefighting and related companies 
in recent years the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as dynegy inc enron corp reliant inc and others together they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city 
consolidation is cumulative  a selffulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place bill gilmer an economist in houston for the federal reserve bank of dallas wrote in a recent publication the same principles of course are what draw moviemakers to hollywood financial service providers to new york and automakers to detroit 
and it seems energy companies to houston

companies  finance the americas  energy deal savings set to increase

c 2001 financial times limited  all rights reserved
chevrontexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to 18bn by march 2003 
david oreilly chief executive told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of 12bn within six to nine months of the deal which was completed last month
mr oreilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 25 to 3 per cent over the next five years and dismissed worries about the falling oil price 
our business is used to swings and volatility  if you want a stable price environment you dont want to be in this business he told reporters after addressing analysts in new york 
mr oreilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry  the 35bn deal between conoco and phillips petroleum  only made him more confident that the chevrontexaco deal was right 
chevrontexaco now claims to be the thirdlargest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourthlargest in global oil and natural gas production he said the synergies translated into gains of about 1 per share after tax 
chevrontexaco has an important role in dynegys rescue bid for enron the rival energy group chevrontexaco has a 26 per cent stake in dynegy and immediately invested 15bn in convertible preferred shares of dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in enron chevrontexaco is committed to buying a further 1bn of dynegy common stock once dynegy completes its takeover if the deal fails chevrontexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for 15bn in cash or convert to common shares giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity 
mr oreilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at enron 
chevrontexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at enron and mr oreilly said there was a full suite of due diligence that needed to be done on other issues at enron 
 enrons lenders welcomed the energy companys openness yesterday following a meeting in new york greg whalley enrons president led the meeting which was postponed when dynegy began talks with enron two weeks ago 
much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job said one another banker said enron management had been pretty upfront about the problems at the company although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting

usa enron sounds debt alarm reduces reported earnings
by c bryson hull

reuters english news service
c reuters limited 2001
houston nov 19 reuters  humbled energy giant enron corp on monday warned that it could be forced to pay a 690 million debt by next week and reduced its alreadyabysmal thirdquarter earnings 
the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with us securities and exchange commission
among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a 690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week that marked the start of a nineday period that expires on nov 26 during which enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships 
if not the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership which includes a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise 250 million in cash 
the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements since it can illafford to pay the debt now enron has already already maxed out its 3 billion credit line secured roughly 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat 
enron also reduced previously reported 2001 thirdquarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share the move reflects adjustments made after the quarters end enron said 
on oct 16 enron reported a loss of 638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001 on nov 8 enron said it had restated earnings for 19972000 and that net income for the fouryear period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported 
it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay 39 billion to other partnerships the bulk of it to osprey trust and marlin water trust 
such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and would likely have a material adverse impact on enrons ability to continue as a going concern the company wrote 
enron had released those figures earlier but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability 
credit could be a killer 
moodys investors service and standard  poors this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to baa3 and bbbminus just one notch above junk status each warned it may cut its respective ratings again moodys also cut enrons shortterm debt rating which affects commercial paper to not prime a junk rating 
in nearly all of its partnership deals enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels at the close of trading monday on the new york stock exchange enron shares were at 906  well below the trigger prices 
all of the partnerships which enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet have become the onceproud companys bane the sec is investigating potential conflictofinterest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow served as general partner 
enron had to extract itself from those partnerships which led to a 12 billion reduction in enron shareholder equity 
the revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory leaving enron to be bought on nov 9 by smaller crosstown rival dynegy inc for the firesale price of 9 billion in stock 
in an unusual note enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant per sec regulations because of the need of arthur andersen llp enrons independent auditors to complete their review procedures 
arthur andersen had no comment but enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enrons board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audits completion

dow jones business news
copyright c 2001 dow jones  company inc
enron corp warned that continuing credit worries a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourthquarter earnings tuesdays wall street journal reported 
the energy company said it may be forced to take a 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships the partnership whitewing llp held assets with a book value of 47 billion on nov 16 but a drop in the value of enron ene stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of 700 million the company said
in addition enron houston said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a 690 million note that note became a demand obligation on nov 12 when enrons credit rating got lowered to triplebminus by standard  poors the company didnt disclose who holds the note 
weve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets said company spokesman mark palmer one of the assets includes ceg rio a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash 
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and in some cases to keep debt off its balance sheet in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct 31 the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet 
the company on nov 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc dyn but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening the petition alleges that enrons directors breached their fiduciary duties to enrons shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron enron said it would vigorously defend itself 
mondays filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses in its original thirdquarter statement the company reported a loss of 618 million the stated loss was increased to 635 million last week and in the latest filing the loss for the quarter ended sept 30 was widened to 664 million 
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing arent necessarily final because its external auditor arthur andersen hasnt completed its review nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firms accounting practices

houston dow jones enron corp ene filed its form 10q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter 
as reported enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances
on oct 16 enron reported a loss of 618 million on revenue of 476 billion for the third quarter ended sept 30

enron said its independent auditor arthur andersen llp hasnt finalized its review of the companys financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for andersen to complete its review procedures 
in the third quarter enron wrote off more than 1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about 12 billion to unwind an offbalance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer andrew fastow that relationship is being examined in a securities and exchange commission investigation and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits 
according to the companys form 10q the special committees investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters which would require additional or different restatements 

dow jones corporate filings alert reported monday that enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the companys existing cost structure accelerating the process of divesting noncore businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations 
enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance restructuring and other charges according to corporate filings alert 
the company had 1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at sept 30 
on nov 9 enron and dynegy inc dyn signed a definitive merger agreement that would give enron shareholders 02685 share of a dynegy share the merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002

fears mount over enrondynasty deal
bruce francis kathleen hays

cnnfn markets impact
c copyright federal document clearing house all rights reserved
kathleen hays cnnfn anchor markets impact there are mounting fears about the fate of the enron url  dynegy url  deal financial times once again has a scoop robert thomson is the us managing editor of the ft joining us now with details robert whats going on i thought this was suppose to be a done deal 
robert thomson financial times us managing editor well thats right kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause that there is a change in the conditions surrounding enron that makes inaudible a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them and these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the financial times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize
hays well i must say i think this is very interesting and im surprised not that im an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that enron was getting the deal done with dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table so what what do you think what are you hearing that theyre finding now that makes things look worst than they already look 
thomson well really thats the issue to be quite honest we dont know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that enron is in this situation that its now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that inaudible surrounding enron still have it and that they suspect that dynegy might have it it looks quite more inaudible the deal now dynegy is saying but were going ahead with this yes there is that clause there yes it covers us in case we find something that we dont like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we dont feel it will have to activate it but of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it 
hays go ahead robert im sorry 
thomson so but the truth is you know the full extent of enrons exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transactions the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it 
hays what happens if the deal falls through what happen to enron 
thomson well theres a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this theres certainly concern in the banking community again that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to enron isnt fully comprehended and frankly thats why they spoke to the financial times because they thought well theres an impression that this is a done deal that the enron problem is solved theyre saying actually not so 
hays wow well i think we have just enough time to take a look at youre you got us something in china again you take us to that world part of the world frequently whats going on there 
thomson yeah we beijing inaudible here essentially the ifc the international finance corporation arm of the world bank is taking a large stake in chinese bank in nanjing ph that is amazing really its by far the largest stake 27 million 15 percent in the nanjingph city bank and its really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in chinese banks over the next year or so there are two small ones there already where people have taken 3 5 percent in chinese banks but for the first time international institutions are in a position where they can think about chinese retail banking in a serious way 
hays ok robert well thank you very much i guess thats something for investors to watch particularly people who are global investors

enron reduces earnings warns 690 mln payment due update2
20011119 2203 new york

enron reduces earnings warns 690 mln payment due update2

     adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week

     houston nov 19 bloomberg  enron corp which agreed to
a takeover by dynegy inc after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy revised thirdquarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
690 million note next week

     the houstonbased company lowered results by 3 cents a share
bringing its thirdquarter loss to 87 cents or 664 million
according to a securities  exchange commission filing
liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth
quarter earnings by 700 million before taxes enron said

     the disclosures dont indicate that enron is in much worse
shape than on nov 8 said john olson an energy analyst at
sanders morris harris thats when enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by 586 million reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books

     i dont think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust thirdquarter earnings again considering they
restated earnings for the last four years said olson who
doesnt own shares of dynegy or enron i dont think its a
problem

     making good on debt owed by its whitewing partnership may cut
enrons fourthquarter earnings enron is obligated to back
whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock because
enrons stock has plunged it may have to write down its assets by
700 million the filing said

                       partnership problems

     enron said that the dynegy buyout could collapse if enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than 2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if enrons litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to 35 billion or more enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits

     enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments

     chief executive officer kenneth lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
enron shareholders 12 billion in lost equity the company wrote
off 101 billion in investments in water telecommunications and
retailenergy sales in the third quarter

     a drop in enrons senior unsecured debt rating to bbb by
standard  poors on nov 12 may force enron to pay off the 690
million note by nov 27 if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership the company
said

                        brazilian liability

     without repayment or collateral investors in a partnership
that owns brazilian naturalgas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnerships assets enron said enron said its working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt

     if we cant talk lenders into refinancing there is the
possibility that    note would be due next week said karen
denne an enron spokeswoman

     as of friday the company had 13 billion in cash on hand
it expects to close on 450 million in additional financing
tomorrow and to complete 800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year its also trying to find investors who will put 500
million to 1 billion into the company

     the company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral it received 15 billion from
chevrontexaco last week as part of the dynegy buyout agreement in
return dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through

     enron closed on a 550 million loan from jp morgan chase 
co and salomon smith barney inc on wednesday that was secured
with assets of enrons transwestern pipeline co it expects to
close on another 450 million loan secured with other northern
natural gas assets this week denne said the commitment for the
loans was announced nov 1


                      39 billion liability

     the company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes a further drop in its
debt rating which would put it below investment grade would
trigger repayment of 39 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies enron said

     the rating drop would force it to repay 24 billion in debt
owed by osprey trust and 915 million in debt taken on by marlin
water trust the company said in the filing

     arthur andersen llp enrons auditor didnt grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships enron said the sec is also investigating the
partnerships which were run by enron executives

     the filing was released after the stock market closed shares
of enron rose 6 cents to 906 dynegy rose 113 to 4360
chevrontexaco corp which owns 26 percent of dynegy and is
providing 25 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout fell
54 cents to 8291

chevrontexaco sees investor suits as threat to enron update1

     updates with enron reducing thirdquarter results in last
paragraph

     new york nov 19 bloomberg  enron corps exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
dynegy inc said david oreilly chief executive officer of
chevrontexaco inc which is helping to back dynegys purchase

     chevrontexaco is paying particular attention to the
litigation risk though we still think its a good deal for
dynegy and an even better deal for chevrontexaco reilly said at
an analyst meeting in new york

     chevrontexaco the secondbiggest us oil company owns 27
percent of dynegy it agreed to provide dynegy 25 billion as
part of the enron purchase dynegy can cancel the bid if enrons
legal liabilities including investor suits exceed 35 billion
enron said today in a regulatory filing it cant calculate the
cost of shareholder suits

     dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival enron the largest
energy trader for stock and debt now valued at 207 billion
enrons stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt

     gold bennett cera  sidner llp filed a class action suit in
houston today alleging enron misrepresented its business and
results other investors have filed similar suits

     chevrontexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months oreilly said there is no transaction
that is risk free he said

     shares of enron rose 6 cents to 906 today they have
tumbled 89 percent this year dynegy gained 113 to 4360 the
stock has declined 22 percent this year both companies are based
in houston

     chenvrontexaco based in san francisco fell 54 cents to
8291

     earlier this month enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by 552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates enron ousted its chief financial officer and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates

     enron reduced thirdquarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a 690 million note
this month according to a filing with the us securities and
exchange commission




enron says it may have to pay off 690 mln note next week
20011119 1816 new york

enron says it may have to pay off 690 mln note next week

     houston nov 19 bloomberg  enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a 690 million note by nov
27 if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt

     repayment was triggered by the nov 12 downgrade in enrons
senior unsecured debt rating to bbb by standard  poors the
company said in a securities filing

     enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it the securities and exchange commission filing said

    without repayment partners in a limited partnership that owns
natural gas assets in brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnerships assets enron said enron said its working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt

     a further drop in its debt rating which would put it below
investment grade would trigger repayment of 39 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies

     the rating drop would trigger repayment of 24 billion in
debt owed by osprey trust and 915 million owed by marlin water
trust the company said in the filing

     enron is being bought by dynegy inc for 25 billion in stock
and debt enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than 2 billion the
dynegy deal could collapse

    the filing was released after the stock market closed  shares
of houstonbased enron rose 6 cents to 906 dynegy shares rose

enrons azurix may have to sell assets if it cant borrow

     houston nov 19 bloomberg  azurix corp enron corps
water unit may have to sell assets if it cant find financing to
continue operations the company said in a regulatory filing

     enron took azurix public in june 1999 and then after the
water companys stock plunged took it private and paid off
investors in march

     azurix isnt sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
1133 million in longterm debt including bank loans that
matures before sept 30 at a reasonable cost it said in a
filing with the us securities and exchange commission the
company also had 3263 million in shortterm debt as of sept 30

     the loans are azurixs primary sources of liquidity the
filing said if the company cant raise the funds it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash the filing said

may need to sell other assets which could result in azurix
incurring losses in future periods the company said

enron must also pay off or refinance 690 million in debt obligations
by nov 26 or risk triggering nearly 4 billion in additional payments
according to the sec filing

if the company doesnt make the payment on that date the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable

in addition enron may sell the limited partnerships assets for
amounts below their carrying values

the net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
enrons obligation  according to the companys 10q filed monday with
the securities and exchange commission

enron is in talks with lenders to develop a mutually acceptable
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the 690 million
note

if the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional 39 billion the company said

"generate subject: california state treasurer phil angelides held a press  conference this 
afternoon to announce that 35 billion in interim financing has  been 
arranged through jp morgan and lehman brothers and that an additional 1  
billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an 
undisclosed  source

the financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued  yesterday by 
the governor that allows bondsales for energy purchased by  the department 
of water resources previously gov davis and treasurer  angelides had 
sought legislative approval of the bond issuance but were not  successful 
further review by state attorneys determined that the governor  could 
authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference  that 
the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be  
usedto backfill past general fund expenditures 

a onepagehandout summarizing the financing has been  sent to houstonthe 
vital statistics are

the authorized loan amount is 5 billion with an initial  35 billion 
committed
the rate is 475 but will jump to 7 if the bonds are not  issued 
successfully by october 31 which is the scheduled maturity date of the  loan 
angelides emphasized that this is not the due  date

the goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from  the general fund 
for power purchases and avert a cash crisis the  financing which also 
provides working capital for continuedstate energy  purchasesis secured by 
revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid  by the bonds

angelides noted that the financing which he hopes to have  totally closed by 
july 1 precludes generators from walking away from contracts  under the 
clause that requires financing by a certain date he said it  satifsies 
most dwr contracts andprecludes arguments made by generators  for a 
credit premium

angelides also said that the financing is important because it  builds 
momentum for the huge revenue bond sale and that it sends a powerful  
signal to wall street that the bond issue is real

according to his figures the general fund is currently out  about 52 
billion net 61 billion in purchases minus 900 million in  revenues in 
power purchases through june 12

steps still must occur before the bonds can be issued he  said the puc has 
to adopt rate agreements adopt a servicing order with  the utilities to 
collect revenues to repay the bonds and has to enact rate  increases of 
about 3 centskwh in sdges territory angelides noted  that the lenders 
have made their financial commitment event though these puc  actions are 
still outstanding

the bonds will not be issued until early september  angelides said late 
august is a terrible time because the financial community is  on a prelabor 
day holiday and that the state would hold off until the more  favorable 
period following the holiday





earlier in the afternoon the foundation for taxpayer and  consumer rights  
harvey rosenfields group  held a press conference to voice  opposition to 
the edison mou they all seem to agree that the mou is  likely dead but are 
afraid of it arising at a later date in some form  

when asked about the business community being asked to  shoulder the costs of 
utilities debt rosenfield said that a problem has arisen  in that business 
wants direct access but dwr has already purchased the power  they dont 
want he believes edison alone should be responsible for its  debt its 
governments role to go forward he said and edisons job to clean  up its 
mess

more penny towards a bailout there will be a referendum on the  bailout and 
the legislators voting for it he said they would be  held personally 
accountable

exactly what he means by this is unclear in  california a referendum  
which is the word he used  is a littleused tool  to overturn legislation 
that has been passed and signed whether he was  threatening recall attempts 
is also unclear

rosenfield added that depending on how things progress there  could be an 
initiative and it could include a public power  component

enron corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares diluting the position of current shareholders 
however enron treasurer ben glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about 33 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities  known as the marlin water trust ii the marlin water capital corp ii the osprey trust and osprey i inc the notes are coming due during the next 20 months
mr glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes also enron is selling other assets proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes which ultimately are guaranteed by enron 
he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least 22 billion by the end of next year this amount includes cash proceeds of 155 billion from the previously announced sale of enrons portland general electric utility unit enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002 
there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes mr glisan said but if we are wrong we will issue equity mr glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 billion in stock enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding 
making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enrons share price in 4 pm new york stock exchange composite trading enron shares were down 86 cents to 1979 the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands early this year enron stock was more than 80 a share 
during the past week shares of the energytrading giant have dropped more than 40 early last week enron reported a 618 million thirdquarter loss resulting from 101 billion in writeoffs the company also disclosed a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s fastow in july mr fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors on monday enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr fastow enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper 
the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while we are extremely disappointed with our stock price    our businesses are performing very well mr lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs 
mr fastow the chief financial officer took part in the conference call but neither he nor mr lay would answer any questions concerning the fastowrelated partnership which was known as ljm2 coinvestment lp mr lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement which has raised conflictofinterest questions among analysts and others mr lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions mr lay said he was very concerned about the way andys character has been loosely tossed about he added we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy 
internal ljm2 documents indicate that mr fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljm2related transactions according to enron sec filings 
during the conference call analysts  even some who have been longtime enron fans  challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the companys often opaque financial reports theres the appearance you are hiding something said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board 
mr lay responded were trying to be as transparent as we can

enron tries to dismiss finance doubts

enron has ample access to cash the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities 
in a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after enrons stock plunged on monday the chief executive kenneth w lay strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the securities and exchange commission was looking into
but he refused to go into detail on the transaction that enron made with partnerships run by andrew s fastow the chief financial officer in addition mr fastow while declaring that enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations declined to answer any questions about it 
the conference call which began just as trading opened on the new york stock exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to 2325 but it soon began falling and ended the day down 86 cents at 1979 the days low of 1962 was the lowest since jan 12 1998 and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000 
until recently most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets but the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalancesheet financing one involving partnerships controlled by mr fastow led to a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to sec inquiries that the company disclosed on monday 
one of the companys strongest supporters has been david fleischer an analyst at goldman sachs but he told mr lay on the call yesterday that enron had to be more forthcoming with information there is an appearance that you are hiding something he said 
after the call mr fleischer expressed disappointment theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand he said in an interview they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed he said but he said he was still recommending the stock i dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans he said in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here 
mr lay cited the sec inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr fastow but he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy 
mr lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called marlin that company owns onethird of azurix an enron subsidiary that owns wessex a british water utility the auditors have determined there is no writedown required he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management a money management firm 
mr grubman said that marlin owed almost 1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake noting that enron had paid about 300 million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in azurix mr grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares 
mr lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details eventually he cut off mr grubman i know youre trying to drive the stock price down and youve done a pretty good job of it mr lay said but lets move on to the next question 
mr fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had 185 billion in such debt outstanding he said it was backed by 335 billion in bank lines of credit of which 175 billion will expire next may if it is not renewed 
mr lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts that reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not he said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises 
the large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release but it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement the sec is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct 
after one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as marlin mr lay said the company will look into providing such statements

surge in optimism prompts straddles in enron and cisco

new york  bullish calls traded heavily early as investors encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies 
at one point the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the chicago board options exchange fell to 028 compared with 068 friday and mondays threemonth closing low of 042
the surge of optimism  also evident in the cboe marketvolatility index or vix  prompted traders to begin covering the downside just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat contrarians believe the cboe equity putcall ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 040 by the sessions end the ratio was at 049 
buyers drove robust call trading in cisco systems a maker of internet switching equipment and the implied volatility also rose noted a trader at letco the cboe specialist for cisco options one investor bought thousands of january 20 calls paying about 115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at 20 a share until midjanuary at 4 pm in nasdaq stock market trading cisco was down 42 cents at 1641 the january 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on cboe volume of 27048 contracts while 6861 contracts traded at the pacific exchange 
the implied volatility of enrons nearmonth options remains high even as the energy concerns executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns following news that the securities and exchange commission is looking at the houston company 
the volatility spike makes enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles  selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration in particular enrons atthemoney january 20 straddles offer rich premiums said lillian seidman of the seidmanskupp options team at miller tabak  co of new york with enron down 86 cents at 1979 in new york stock exchange composite trading selling january 20 straddles would earn an investor about 750 a straddle  a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock 
to be sure selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock which already had fallen about 38 in a week makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range

lay tries to assure enron investors 
companys credibility questioned 
by laura goldberg 
copyright 2001 houston chronicle 
enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with enron the companys chief executive officer said tuesday 
the houstonbased energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over chief financial officer andrew fastows former role with two partnerships ljm cayman and ljm2 coinvestment that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with enron 
enron disclosed monday that the securities and exchange commission opened an informal inquiry into transactions between enron and the two partnerships 
it declined to say if the sec is looking into other transactions 
after the disclosure enrons stock fell almost 21 percent monday tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at 1979 
the news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on wall street that some of enrons financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that enron doesnt provide detailed enough financial data about its performance 
tuesday morning enron chairman and ceo ken lay held a conference call for investors and analysts aimed at addressing their concerns 
it remains to be seen whether he succeeded but based on the tenor of questions during the call its doubtful he achieved that result 
david fleischer a goldman sachs analyst told lay that the companys credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that enrons dealings are aboveboard 
i for one find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions he said 
lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the ljm partnerships because of the sec inquiry 
he did say enron was aware an inherent conflict of interest would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with enron 
in response enron set up procedures which lay said were rigorously followed to ensure shareholder interests wouldnt be compromised 
there was a chinese wall between ljm and enron he said adding that enron wasnt obligated to do deals with the ljm entities and did so when it was in enrons best interest 
lay and enrons board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in fastow he added 
fastow resigned his roles with the ljm entities in june after criticism from wall street 
enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships 
it took a 35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders equity by 12 billion as a result 
during the call enron executives also addressed other issues 
they stressed that enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles whitewing and the atlantic water trust that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or enron shares at the time of the investments 
if enron should lose its current investmentgrade quality debt rating commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of enrons current outstanding shares to become diluted 
jeff dietert an analyst with simmons  co international in houston who follows enron was among those on the call he said afterward he received some new information about enrons lines of credit 
i had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call he said

through enron broadband services the giant energy company boasts about developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity reliability price transparency and guaranteed service levels 
but there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday when enron held a conference call to address investor concerns about its financial dealings 
despite the bandwidth expertise the call  the first time that andrew fastow chief financial officer has faced questions about the transactions from analysts  was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers a live webcast of the call was accessible on enrons website but without the chance to grill enron brass 
those investors and journalists who did make it through some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party others found their lines dropped midstream heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives an analyst chided for his part in lowering the companys share price was told by ken lay enrons chairman that his question quota was up and it was time to move on

new york oct 24 reuters  enron corp treasurer ben glisan said the company thinks it can repay about 33 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock the wall street journal reported in its online edition on wednesday 
enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles which could involve issuing additional shares thereby diluting the position of current shareholders the report said
the report which cites a tuesday interview with glisan said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months the entities are known as the marlin water trust ii the marlin water capital corp ii the osprey trust and osprey i inc the report said 
according to the report glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes enron is selling other assets the report said according to the newspaper proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes which are ultimately guaranteed by enron 
glisan according to the report said it looks like asset sales will raise at least 22 billion by the end of 2002 
there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes glisan said according to the report but if we are wrong we will issue equity 
according to the report glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 billion in stock 
enron held a conference call on tuesday seeking to assuage investor concerns after us regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the companys chief financial officer and its stock shed more than 10 billion in value over the past week 
enron said on the call it can tap 335 billion from a credit line suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business which can experience wide swings in cash flow depending on commodity prices and market hedges

enron may issue more stock to cover obligations

enron corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created wednesdays wall street journal reported 
covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron ene shares diluting the position of current shareholders
however enron treasurer ben glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about 33 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities  known as the marlin water trust ii the marlin water capital corp ii the osprey trust and osprey i inc the notes are coming due during the next 20 months 
mr glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes also enron is selling other assets proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes which ultimately are guaranteed by enron 
he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least 22 billion by the end of next year this amount includes cash proceeds of 155 billion from the previously announced sale of enrons portland general electric utility unit enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002 
there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes mr glisan said but if we are wrong we will issue equity mr glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 billion in stock enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding 
making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enrons share price in 4 pm new york stock exchange composite trading enron shares were down 86 cents to 1979 the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands early this year enron stock was more than 80 a share

everest re st paul and providian drop but markets stay resilient

copyright c 2001 dow jones  company inc

new york  stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements 
shares of drug maker pharmacia fell 437 or 13 to 3839 after the company issued thirdquarter results that topped wall streets forecasts but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed
in fact several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements shares of bristolmyers squibb for example gave up 168 or 28 to 5802 american home products lost 140 or 23 to 5890 and scheringplough eased 74 cents or 19 to 3817 
shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements with everest re falling 640 or 84 to 6950 and st paul dropping 93 cents or 19 to 4925 
power utility exelon chicago was set back 342 or 77 to 4108 after its thirdquarter results topped forecasts but drew critical comments from several analysts 
nevertheless even with the grim earnings outlook investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel 
institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market richard cripps market strategist at legg mason said their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly which is eminently possible and they cant afford to miss it 
some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently for many mutual funds for example their fiscal year concludes at the end of october some are doing what is called window dressing  buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio  while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market 
whatever the reason the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen and modest moves when they have declined the dow jones industrial average which ran up 17292 points monday declined 3695 points yesterday a loss of 039 to 934008 
the nasdaq composite index declined 364 points or 021 to 170444 volume levels showed some improvement over mondays rather sluggish pace 
investors havent completely rolled over in a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised they have lashed those stocks repeatedly shares of sbc communications one of mondays disappointments got punished again falling 262 or 63 to 3878 and fell back in range of a 52week low of 3820 set june 26 
consumer lender providian financial got sent to a fresh 52week low off 41 cents or 83 to 455 enron which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company a power marketer and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer dropped an additional 86 cents or 42 to 1979 hitting a 52week low intraday 
there were some winning profit statements shares of csx for example rose 245 or 75 to 3519 after the richmond va railfreight concern reported thirdquarter earnings that while they fell short of yearago performance nevertheless managed to top wall streets forecasts 
vitesse semiconductor nasdaq a camarillo calif maker of integrated circuits used in highbandwidth communications networks added 43 cents or 45 to 999 even though the companys losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected 
netiq nasdaq dropped 423 or 14 to 2617 even though the santa clara calif developer of networking software posted fiscal firstquarter results late monday that topped what analysts had been looking for 
chartered semiconductor nasdaq advanced 40 cents or 21 to 1910 the singapore chip foundry reported thirdquarter results that showed a loss for the period but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected 
shares of several cabletelevision operators moved higher charter communications added 59 cents or 45 to 1362 comcast gained 40 cents or 11 to 3682 and cox communications rose 44 cents or 11 to 4015 thomas weisel partners said that cable operators should benefit from sbc communications decision revealed monday with its quarterly results to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering 
earthlink nasdaq slid 251 or 14 to 1485 the atlanta internet service provider issued strongerthanexpected thirdquarter results but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed 
att wireless increased 126 or 97 to 1420 the redmond wash provider of wireless communications services reported thirdquarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for 
several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late monday by the us trade commission which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports usxus steel group gained 28 cents or 19 to 1502 nucor rose 105 or 25 to 4287 and ak steel improved 41 cents or 46 to 931 
mckesson advanced 156 or 42 to 3895 the san francisco drug distributor and healthcare information technology provider posted strongerthanexpected fiscal secondquarter results 
watson pharmaceuticals fell 305 or 6 to 4811 ubs warburg reduced its rating on the corona calif drug maker and lowered its earnings projections for the company 
furniture brands dropped 204 or 89 to 2096 ubs warburg cut its rating on the st louis furniture manufacturer saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers

uk lng delays could spawn shipping crisis  analysts
by pete harrison

reuters english news service
c reuters limited 2001

london oct 24 reuters  the transport chain supporting the global lng industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines shipping analysts warn 
more lng tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the far east many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand which might emerge later than scheduled
the issue is timing jarle sjo shipping equity analyst at oslobased investment bank first securities told reuters 
historically lng projects have been delayed  you can estimate at about six months  and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term he added 
the world fleet of lng tankers currently numbers 123 but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004 according to shipping database fairplay 
gas industry analysts expect some lng projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn excess capacity at existing plants in asia and a sharp fall in us natural gas prices this year 
svein erik amundsen managing director of norwegian shipping group bergesen said that a sustained economic downturn could have consequences 
i wouldnt be surprised by project delays he told reuters this could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment 
i think you can say were still optimistic but more cautiously optimistic than before he added bergesen has three new lng ships on order two of which have already been contracted out to belgian gas distributor distrigas 
stop and think 
the worlds largest and only pure lng shipping player golar lng historically bullish in its outlook has also been forced to stop and consider the problem 
golar has six ships locked into longterm contracts but four more are under construction at south koreas daewoo and hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment 
there is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered golar executive vp sveinung stohle told reuters the only risk is things might be delayed 
stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option but it was also developing an lng trading arm which might have a use for some of them 
golars closest competitor in terms of size exmar is taking a more traditional approach it has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance 
weve chartered out all of them except the samsung ship which is under offer for the qatari rasgas tender managing director nicolas saverys told reuters four are booked out to el paso and one to enron 
he said that until all the upcoming projects had their supply production agreements in place it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders 
its a good time to wait said saverys

house stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies senate democrats present alternative

copyright 2001 the associated press all rights reserved

washington ap  general motors ibm and kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a 100 billion house republican economic stimulus package democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals 
seven companies would get a total of 33 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986 the tax which the house legislation also would repeal outright is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits
ibm would get a 14 billion refund according to the nonpartisan congressional research service while gm would get 832 million kmart 102 million and general electric 671 million others specified for big refunds include energy giant enron at 254 million us steel 39 million and grocery chain kroger 9 million 
in addition the study found that ford motor co would get a refund that could total 23 billion while chevrons could reach 314 million 
counting repeal of the tax corporations would get more than 25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone in addition the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business providing them 21 billion in tax relief over 10 years 
the generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the house gop measure scheduled for a floor vote wednesday democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the senate the bush administration also has signaled that 100 billion is too costly 
its clear the house bill cannot pass the senate as it is said sen john breaux dla 
for individuals the house legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didnt get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002 four years earlier than under the justenacted tax cut the measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers enhances business equipment writeoffs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier 
the primary sponsor ways and means committee chairman bill thomas said in a newspaper opinion piece published tuesday in usa today that the legislation is a shot of adrenaline that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation 
businesses generate jobs and jobs are the core of a strong economy wrote thomas rcalif 
while bipartisan support backs some of the house items senate democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance sen max baucus chairman of the senate finance committee presented a 70 billion proposal tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks provide a 50 percent federal match for cobra health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for medicaid 
the legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the house bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief tax cuts in the baucus measure would total 35 billion in 2002 far below the house gop level 
this proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly said baucus dmont 
other democrats were working on spending programs senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva said he was putting together a 20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines 
sen charles grassley riowa said president bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending 
everything in this package needs to be stimulative grassley said there needs to be more done on the investment side

requesttext  please provide a short description of each line in the two 
tables lines 424 including a a comparison of the differences between the 
two tables either the reasons for any differences in amounts for a line 
description that is the same in both tables or the reason for any 
differences in the logic of the calculations and b a crosswalk8 showing 
how each line in each table corresponds to a variable or equation or both 
in section f of the grsps beginning on p 15 of attachment a to this 
testimony



responsetext
the following two tables are excerpted out of wp02ebpa77 page 9 lines 
426


table illustrating jcg method










table illustrating bpa method













before beginning the comparison of the two tables it should be pointed out 
that the tables calculate gross augmentation costs  we left out the step 
that calculates the net augmentation costs  as a result the total8 line 
dollar amounts 6m and 62m in the jcg table and 6m and 6m in the bpa 
table should all be reduced by the amount of augmentation resale revenue  
however since this modification will not affect the comparison requested in 
the data request let us continue as if the total8 line dollar amounts are 
already net of the augmentation revenue see the attachment to the data 
response



















another item that may be confusing is the item labeled prepurchase  0 day 
rule8  this is the incremental cost associated with purchases made between 
the 120day cutoff and the 0day cutoff

also a crosswalk of each table showing how it corresponds to a variable or 
equation in section f is not possible since section f reflects the bpa 
method not the jcg method  perhaps an overview of bpas perspective on the 
difference between the jcg method and the bpa method will be helpful

jcg calculated the augmentation costs using two different cost pools one 
cost pool for the slice product using the 120 day rule and a second cost 
pool for all other products using the 0 day rule  the products then 
collected a portion of the augmentation costs associated with a specific 
rule  when these two cost pools yield different net augmentation costs 
which they usually will unless all of the augmentation is purchased under 
the 120day rule the jcg method doesnt collect the actual amount of either 
of those pools from slice or nonslice  rather it collects a proportion of 
each of the cost pools

in contrast to the jcg method the bpa method distributes the costs using the 
120day rule proportionally between the slice and nonslice products and 
then assesses all the incremental cost from using the 0day rule rather than 
the 120day rule to the nonslice products  in contrast to jcg method this 
assures that all the actual incremental net augmentation costs calculated by 
replacing the 120day8 rule with the 0day8 rule are recovered  from 
purchasers of nonslice power products  in addition this also assures that 
purchasers of the slice product do not bear any nearer term market prices 
fluctuations

now for a short description of each line in the two tables and a comparison 
of the differences  the example assumes that we dont actually purchase all 
of our augmentation that some of it is served from bpas secondary or is 
bought in the spot market

prepurchase  120 day rule8 is the total cost of augmentation purchases 
made at least 120 days prior to the month of delivery  this amount is 2m in 
both tables in both columns  this amount represents the sum of diurnalaca 
for the sixmonth period  this would have represented diurnalacas in the 
grsps proposed by the jcg in their direct case

prepurchase  0 day rule8 is the additional cost of prepurchases made less 
than 120 days prior to the month of delivery  this amount is 1m in both 
tables in the nonslice column  the 0day rule prepurchases are not 
applicable to the slice product thus the na in the slice column in both 
tables  if prepurchase  120 day rule8 and prepurchase  0 day rule8 
were summed the sum would represent diurnalacans in the grsps proposed by 
the customers  note that the prepurchase  0 day rule appears in a 
different row in the bpa table since bpa has proposed that these incremental 
cost enter the calculations at a different point

short position is the cost of the amount of aamta that is not prepurchased  
this is the amount that is valued at price in the grsps  in the jcg the 
short position is different between the slice and nonslice columns  this is 
because the example has bpa purchasing some additional augmentation 1m 
worth under the 0day rule and there is a corresponding reduction in the 
value of bpas short position  the change also reflects that the short 
position is valued using different prices for the 120 day rule and the 0 day 
rule  in the bpa example short position is 3m for both slice and nonslice 
products and the difference 08m is found in the row short position 0 
day rule8

buydown8 is the cost of all buydowns  it is the same in both tables for 
both slice and nonslice products  in the examples bpa spent 1m buying down 
load

total8 is the gross cost of augmentation  as stated above it should be 
reduced by the augmentation resale revenue  to continue on let us assume 
that total8 has been reduced by augmentation resale revenue and represents 
the net augmentation costs  in the jcg  example total8 is 6m for slice 
and 62m for nonslice  these would represent nacas and nacans in the 
grsps proposed by the jcg in their direct case  in the bpa example total 
is 6m for both slice and nonslice  this represents naca in the bpa grsps

percent of cracable revenue8 is the same in both tables  the example shows 
that the slice revenue is 30 of the total cracable revenue and the 
nonslice revenue is 70 of the total cracable revenue

lb crac costs8 only appears in the bpa example  it is the naca distributed 
between slice and nonslice products in proportion to actual revenue

prepurchase 0 day rule8 and short position 0 day rule8 are the changes in 
the valuation of prepurchases 1m and short position 08m between the 
120 day rule and the 0 day rule  the net difference of 02m is equivalent 
to the difference that is seen in total8 in the jcg example the difference 
between 6m and 62m  this difference is also equivalent to nacdiff in the 
bpa grsps

total lb crac costs8 is the cost that the slice and nonslice groups true 
up to  in the jcg example the slice product trues up to 30 of 6m or 
18m while the nonslice products true up to 70 of 62m for a total from 
both groups of 614m  in bpas example the slice product pays 30 of 6m 
or 18m the same as in the jcg example while the nonslice products pay 
70 of 6m plus the net difference between valuation of net augmentation 
costs using the 120 day rule and valuation using the 0 day rule  the 
nonslice amount is 42m plus 02m or 44m

the boxer rebellion

on tuesday western peak power prices dipped slightly amid abundant
northwest hydro flows sluggish holiday demand and slightly lower spot gas
prices  a lot of schools and businesses are beginning to close for the
holidays and loads should remain at lackluster levels until after the start
of the new year said one marketer  spot gas prices fell about 10 cents on
all of the western pipelines  at the southern california border spot gas
reportedly traded between 263 to 268mmbtu down from mondays range of
274 to 279mmbtu  nymex henry hub futures contracts also slid tuesday on
ample storage but the decline was likely limited by colder weather
forecasts for much of the eastern half of the united states  january hub
gas slipped 29 cents to close at 2657mmbtu while february lost 49
cents to end at 2712mmbtu  after wednesdays inventory report is
released with most players expecting a 20 to 70bcf draw the aga will
delay its next two reports due to the christmas and new years holidays
the next report will be released at 1400 est on thursday december 27 and
then again on thursday january 3 2002  in the political arena democratic
senators barbara boxer and jon corzine proposed legislation on tuesday
requiring more diversification in pension plans to protect other us
workers from the retirement savings fiasco that crippled many enron corp
employees  the two senators also called for a thorough investigation of the
events leading up to enrons collapse  according to reuters boxer and
corzine said about 67 of the assets in enron 401k retirement plans were
invested in enron stock and they proposed limiting the investment an
employee can have in any one stock in their 401k to 20 percent  no one
who gives investment advice would ever recommend someone being invested at
67 said corzine at a news conference  their proposal also called for
limiting the time an employer can force an employee to hold a matching
employer stock contribution in the employees individual account plan to 90
days  that proposal would increase the tax liability of the employer when
matching contributions to an employees 401k are made in company stock
with congress preparing to recess soon for the year boxer and corzines
bill will likely have to wait until next year to progress and the bill does
not at this point have republican support

heavy load energy costs in the northwest fell by an average of 75 cents on
wednesday as abundant hydro flows and lower demand placed downward pressure
on the market  light load goods gained as much as 5mwh on the low end
from a day ago which was misleading since most monday transactions took
place on the upper end of the spectrum  there was not much of a range out
there today and consequently not as much activity said one
washingtonbased trader  recent rains have continued to spawn hearty river
flows in the hydroheavy region but water watchers warned that if the
soaking continues rising flows could begin cutting into maximum generation
flow forecasts for chief joseph were little changed from a day ago coming
in at 95 kcfs wednesday 90 kcfs thursday and friday 65 kcfs saturday 55
kcfs sunday 75 kcfs christmas eve and 65 kcfs on christmas day  weather
forecasts for the regions major load centers called for nearnormal
temperatures into the weekend while the latest sixtoten from the nws was
predicting abovenormal conditions for most of the northwest from december
24 to 28

amid softer spot natural gas prices at the socal border and weaker demand
spot electricity prices softened in the golden state on tuesday  heavy load
goods at np15 traded between 305 and 33mwh with the bulk of deals done
above 32mwh  light load pieces saw action from 25 to 265mwh with
oddlot deals heard as high as 2725mwh  light load goods at sp15 earned
the dubious honor of the steepest price declines in the west on tuesday
falling more than 4mwh at both ends  traders said lighter loads were the
likely culprits but were generally perplexed by the extent of the
softening  in other news sce reported it would request permission from the
cpuc to increase the rates its customers pay by 18 in 2003  the utility
emphasized that the rate hike was based solely on operating costs and not
related to debt repayment negotiations  sce said upgrades on its
electricity system are necessary in the near future and employee health care
costs have also dramatically increased  on the unit front san onofre 3
1080 mw was derated by 100 mw on tuesday though no cause could be
determined  gasfired etiwanda 4 320 mw returned to service and el
segundo 4 335 mw was operating at 170 mw  calpines sutter plants 546
mw was completely offline down from 235 mw a day ago  los angeles was
expecting high temperatures in the mid60s through saturday while most
other major load centers were expecting highs in the lowtomid50s  the
most current sixtoten called for abovenormal temperatures across
california from december 24 to 28

lower spot gas prices and weaker demand led to a general softening in the
dayahead electricity market in the southwest on tuesday  heavy load energy
at palo verde ranged between 29 and 3075mwh with unconfirmed trades as
low as 2725mwh and as high as 33mwh  in unit news mohave 1 790 mw
was expected to return on wednesday or thursday following tube leak repairs
that began on saturday though most thought wednesday to be a wee bit
optimistic  further to the north coloradobased craig 1 428 mw was
given an etr of sometime on wednesday but most participants were
reportedly not scheduling it in until thursday  the latest sixtoten from
the nws called for normal temperatures in arizona and belownormal
temperatures throughout much of new mexico from december 24 through 28

"generate subject: per discussion with david theresa and myself this morning we have agreed 
that the current most effective approach is for trenajeff k to do the 
executions for london creditcom and for equitydebt trading to do the 
settlements

the trades will be executed in the name of london creditcom  we need to set 
up a morgan stanley account in the name of london creditcom to facilitate 
settlements  

we contacted ketan parekh morgan stanley vp prime brokerage to discuss 
the impact of housing the account in ny vs morgan stanley london  ketan 
said that they have many clients that are settling activity from europe in 
their ny prime brokerage accounts with no problems  since the ny and london 
would be different settlement streams and in light of the current anticipated 
activity we are requesting we open an account in morgan stanley ny  

sara david suggested that paul simons would be the contact for account 
opening information

please do not hesitate to call if questions

strategic challenges grow in environmental arena

the issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for
their relatively long time horizons thus although the uncertainty created by
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction in the immediate future
however the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while
maintaining longterm objectives

 parties to the kyoto protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations
while the us focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear

 the european union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme while individual european nations are developing or
implementing their own potentially incompatible systems

 continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche bringing
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles

re flair construction co inc  purchase of lots six 6 and seven 7
block one 1 the lakes of sterling gate section one 1

dear mr  mrs mcconnell

enclosed is a blue lined copy of the survey we received today from the title
company  please note that there is a thirty five foot 35 reliant
energyentex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot 14 utility easement at
the rear of the property  in addition the fourteen foot 14 utility
easement runs along the northwest property line  as such no permanent
fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements including a
swimming pool gazebo or similar structure

the earnest money contract provides that you have seven 7 days from the
receipt of the survey to object in writing to items appearing on the survey
however we do not believe that flair construction can alter these
easements in any way shape or form and as such the easements will most
likely remain intact  if you feel that the easements will impair the
construction of your home swimming pool or related structures please
advise us immediately so that we may notify flair of your objections  if
the objections are not cured within twenty 20 days after flair receives
them in writing the closing date may be extended  if however the
objections are not cured by the extended closing date the contract will
terminate and your earnest money should be refunded to you  we just wanted
to make sure that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter

assuming the easements cause you no problems you should be ready to close
we will be happy to schedule a closing with the title company and with flair
if you can provide us with a number of dates that are convenient for both of
you to appear at the closing  we will be happy to appear as well

senate epw panel hears differing views on changing tva 

the federally owned tennessee valley authority was put on the defensive at a 
senate environment and public works committee hearing last week as its 
adversaries mounted an offensive against the power agency for its huge 27 
billion debt and unaccountability 

with a bill s 1323 introduced by sen mitch mcconnell rky serving as 
the backdrop the need for changing tvas role in an emerging competitive 
electricity market was reviewed 

tva is one of the biggest power producers in the country and it enjoys 
certain unfair privileges according to investorowned utilities which are 
seeking changes to tva to level the playing field in a competitive 
electricity market 

mcconnells bill is touted as making tva more accountable by subjecting the 
power agency to among other things antitrust laws and to the jurisdiction 
of the federal energy regulatory commission mcconnell who was present at 
the hearing questioned tva on its claim of providing lowcost power and why 
it should not be brought under ferc authority 

supporting the position of s 1323 robert hewett representing tva watch a 
coalition led by duke energy and other private utilities decried the 
privileges tva is endowed with hewett said tva has the ability to set its 
own wholesale and retail rates is exempt from antitrust laws and makes only 
token payments in lieu of taxes to the local government no other entity 
in the country even comes close to having this type of authority or license 
said hewett 

hewett wants tva to be subjected to antitrust laws and ferc jurisdiction in 
addition tva must be restricted from building new generation capacity and it 
should not have preferential access to power from other federal facilities at 
rates below fair market value hewett recommended 

richard munson executive director northeastmidwest institute continued on 
the same stream as hewett calling tva a national problem munson said tvas 
inspector general in a recent report has highlighted tvas most serious 
problem  its unaccountability decisions by tvas board of directors are 
not reviewed by state regulators or federal agencies and the power agency 
enjoys a monopoly in its service territory so it is not accountable even to 
market forces according to munson stating that tva has been propped up by 
enormous taxpayer subsidies munson said the giant utility is exempt from 
hundreds of federal and state laws and regulations it pays no federal or 
state taxes and it obtains lowcost loans because of washingtons implied 
support 

but mark medford tva executive vice president cautioned that proposals such 
as s 1323 may risk compromising the lowcost reliable electricity available 
to the tennessee valley region 

medford said s 1323 would place new restrictions on tva and expand 
regulation of tva activities which seems unusual in the context of a 
discussion of deregulation of the electricity industry 

medford also argued against ferc and state regulation of tva prices and ferc 
determination of the need for new generation capacity he said responsibility 
for fulfilling those missions is placed on the threemember tva board 
nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate superimposing a 
higher regulatory body such as ferc to pass judgment on the decision of 
the tva board in these areas seems both duplicative and inappropriate 

medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to tva 
because it would be unfair to tva ratepayers when a private utility 
violates the antitrust laws its stockholders bear the cost however 
governmental entities like tva have no stockholders and the financial costs 
of such penalties have to be borne by the people who are supposed to be 
served said medford 

medford asserted that investors now hold all of tvas debt that finances the 
power program he said tva debt is neither backed by the federal government 
nor is it supported by mortgages on tva plant property and equipment it is 
secured solely by the financial operation of tva as well as bond covenants 
and the provisions of the tva act medford said

also medford said tva has been on the path of debt reduction in the last 
three years bringing down the debt by 1 billion 

austin caroll representing the kentucky managers association a group of 
municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities did not totally agree 
with the principles of s 1323 though it did want some changes to be made to 
tva 

preceding the examination of s 1323 was a hearing on the nomination of tva 
board members  skila harris and glenn mccullough 

harris served until recently as the executive director of the secretary of 
energy advisory board managing the work of the tennessee valley advisory 
committee which comprises of representatives from groups interested in the 
future of tva 

mccullough previously served on the executive committee of the mississippi 
municipal league and as the director of the mississippi office of the 
appalachian regional commission 

the tva board of directors has three members serving nine year staggered 
terms",senate tva hearing,eesi environement energy weekly october 11 1999

karens redline   the gist of the changes is that the owner is a beneficiary 
under the contract but has minimal obligations thereunder   the 
construction manager has most of the obligations but cannot provide the 
indemnification eecc is used to seeing from their counterparty  

lisa  there may be spots where you do or do not want the owner mentioned  i 
tried to limit it to when the owner was a beneficiary but that may strain
